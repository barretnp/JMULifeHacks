computational perspectives on social phenomena at global scales  2
jon kleinberg

the growth of social media and on line social networks has opened up a set of fascinating new challenges and directions for researchers in both computing and the social sciences and an active interface is growing between these areas we discuss a set of basic questions that arise in the design and analysis of systems supporting on line social interactions focusing on two main issues the role of network structure in the dynamics of social media sites and the analysis of textual data as a way to study properties of on line social interaction

soft robotics the next generation of intelligent machines  5
rolf pfeifer hugo gravato marques fumiya iida

there has been an increasing interest in applying biological principles to the design and control of robots unlike industrial robots that are programmed to execute a rather limited number of tasks the new generation of bio inspired robots is expected to display a wide range of behaviours in unpredictable environments as well as to interact safely and smoothly with human co workers in this article we put forward some of the properties that will characterize these new robots soft materials flexible and stretchable sensors modular and efficient actuators self organization and distributed control we introduce a number of design principles in particular we try to comprehend the novel design space that now includes soft materials and requires a completely different way of thinking about control we also introduce a recent case study of developing a complex humanoid robot discuss the lessons learned and speculate about future challenges and perspectives

computational disaster management  12
pascal van hentenryck

the frequency and intensity of natural disasters have significantly increased over the past decades and this trend is predicted to continue natural disasters have dramatic impacts on human lives and on the socio economic welfare of entire regions they are identified as one of the major risks of the east asia and pacific region which represents 85 percents of all people affected since 2007 moreover this exposure will likely double by 2050 due to rapid urbanization and climate change dramatic events such as hurricane katrina and the tohoku tsunami have also emphasized the strong need for optimization tools in preparing mitigating responding and recovering from disasters complementing the role of situational awareness that had been the focus in the past this talk presents some of the progress accomplished in the last 5 years and deployed to assist the response to hurricanes such as irene and sandy it describes the computational challenges ahead in optimization simulation and the modeling of complex inter dependent infrastructures and sketches the disaster management platform built at nicta

agent based and multiagent systems

reasoning about normative update  20
natasha alechina mehdi dastani brian logan

we consider the problem of updating a multi agent system with a set of conditional norms a norm comes into effect when its condition becomes true and imposes either an obligation or a prohibition on an agent which remains in force until a state satisfying a deadline condition is reached if the norm is violated a sanction is imposed on the agent we define a notion of a normative update of a multi agent system by a set of conditional norms and study the problem of checking whether the agents can bring about a state satisfying a property without incurring a specified number of sanctions

undecidability in epistemic planning  27
guillaume aucher thomas bolander

dynamic epistemic logic del provides a very expressive framework for multi agent planning that can deal with nondeterminism partial observability sensing actions and arbitrary nesting of beliefs about other agents beliefs however as we show in this paper this expressiveness comes at a price the planning framework is undecidable even if we allow only purely epistemic actions actions that change only beliefs not ontic facts undecidability holds already in the s5 setting with at least 2 agents and even with 1 agent in s4 it shows that multi agent planning is robustly undecidable if we assume that agents can reason with an arbitrary nesting of beliefs about beliefs we also prove a corollary showing undecidability of the del model checking problem with the star operator on actions iteration

maximal recursive rule a new social decision scheme  34
haris aziz

in social choice settings with strict preferences random dictatorship rules were characterized by gibbard 1977 as the only randomized social choice functions that satisfy strategyproofness and ex post efficiency in the more general domain with indifferences rsd random serial dictatorship rules are the well known and perhaps only known generalization of random dictatorship we present a new generalization of random dictatorship for indifferences called maximal recursive mr rule as an alternative to rsd we show that mr is polynomial time computable weakly strategyproof with respect to stochastic dominance and in some respects outperforms rsd on efficiency

audit games  41
jeremiah blocki nicolas christin anupam datta ariel d procaccia arunesh sinha

effective enforcement of laws and policies requires expending resources to prevent and detect offenders as well as appropriate punishment schemes to deter violators in particular enforcement of privacy laws and policies inmodern organizations that hold large volumes of personal information eg hospitals banks relies heavily on internal audit mechanisms we study economic considerations in the design of these mechanisms focusing in particular on effective resource allocation and appropriate punishment schemes we present an audit game model that is a natural generalization of a standard security game model for resource allocation with an additional punishment parameter computing the stackelberg equilibrium for this game is challenging because it involves solving an optimization problem with non convex quadratic constraints we present an additive fptas that efficiently computes the solution

using double oracle method and serialized alpha beta search for pruning in simultaneous move games  48
branislav bosansky viliam lisy  jiri cermák roman vítek michal pechoucek

we focus on solving two player zero sum extensive form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves in these games both players fully observe the current state of the game where they simultaneously make a move determining the next state of the game we solve these games by a novel algorithm that relies on two components 1 it iteratively solves the games that correspond to a single simultaneous move using a double oracle method and 2 it prunes the states of the game using bounds on the sub game values obtained by the classical alpha beta search on a serialized variant of the game we experimentally evaluate our algorithm on the goofspiel card game a pursuit evasion game and randomly generated games the results show that our novel algorithm typically provides significant running time improvements and reduction in the number of evaluated nodes compared to the full search algorithm

externalities in cake cutting  55
simina branzei ariel d procaccia jie zhang

the cake cutting problem models the fair division of a heterogeneous good between multiple agents previous work assumes that each agent derives value only from its own piece however agents may also care about the pieces assigned to other agents such externalities naturally arise in fair division settings we extend the classical model to capture externalities and generalize the classical fairness notions of proportionality and envy freeness our technical results characterize the relationship between these generalized properties establish the existence or nonexistence of fair allocations and explore the computational feasibility of fairness in the face of externalities

are there any nicely structured preference profiles nearby  62
robert bredereck jiehua chen gerhard j woeginger

we investigate the problem of deciding whether a given preference profile is close to a nicely structured preference profile of a certain type as for instance single peaked single caved single crossing value restricted best restricted worst restricted medium restricted or group separable profiles we measure this distance by the number of voters or alternatives that have to be deleted so as to reach a nicely structured profile our results classify all considered problem variants with respect to their computational complexity and draw a clear line between computationally tractable polynomial time solvable and computationally intractable np hard questions

conditional restricted boltzmann machines for negotiations in highly competitive and complex domains  69
siqi chen haitham bou ammar karl tuyls gerhard weiss

learning in automated negotiations while useful is hard because of the indirect way the target function can be observed and the limited amount of experience available to learn from this paper proposes two novel opponent modeling techniques based on deep learning methods moreover to improve the learning efficacy of negotiating agents the second approach is also capable of transferring knowledge efficiently between negotiation tasks transfer is conducted by automatically mapping the source knowledge to the target in a rich feature space experiments show that using these techniques the proposed strategies outperform existing state of the art agents in highly competitive and complex negotiation domains furthermore the empirical game theoretic analysis reveals the robustness of the proposed strategies

kemeny elections with bounded single peaked or single crossing width  76
denis cornaz lucie galand olivier spanjaard

this paper is devoted to complexity results regarding specific measures of proximity to single peakedness and single crossingness called "single peaked width" cornaz et al 2012 and "single crossing width" thanks to the use of the pq tree data structure booth and lueker 1976 we show that both problems are polynomial time solvable in the general case while it was only known for single peaked width and in the case of narcissistic preferences furthermore we establish one of the first results to our knowledge concerning the effect of nearly single peaked electorates on the complexity of an np hard voting system namely we show the fixed parameter tractability of kemeny elections with respect to the parameters "single peaked width" and "single crossing width"

intention aware routing to minimise delays at electric vehicle charging stations  83
mathijs m de weerdt enrico h gerding sebastian stein valentin robu nicholas r jennings

en route charging stations allow electric vehicles to greatly extend their range however as a full charge takes a considerable amount of time there may be significant waiting times at peak hoursto address this problem we propose a novel navigation system which communicates its intentions ie routing policies to other drivers using these intentions our system accurately predicts congestion at charging stations and suggests the most efficient route to its user we achieve this by extending existing time dependent stochastic routing algorithms to include the batterys state of charge and charging stations furthermore we describe a novel technique for combining historical information with agent intentions to predict the queues at charging stations through simulations we show that our system leads to a significant increase in utility compared to existing approaches that do not explicitly model waiting times or use intentions in some cases reducing waiting times by over 80 and achieving near optimal overall journey times

optimally solving dec pomdps as continuous state mdps  90
jilles steeve dibangoye christopher amato olivier buffet françois charpillet

optimally solving decentralized partially observable markov decision processes dec pomdps is a hard combinatorial problem current algorithms search through the space of full histories for each agent because of the doubly exponential growth in the number of policies in this space as the planning horizon increases these methods quickly become intractable however in real world problems computing policies over the full history space is often unnecessary true histories experienced by the agents often lie near a structured low dimensional manifold embedded into the history space we show that by transforming a dec pomdp into a continuous state mdp we are able to find and exploit these low dimensional representations using this novel transformation we can then apply powerful techniques for solving pomdps and continuous state mdps by combining a general search algorithm and dimension reduction based on feature selection we introduce a novel approach to optimally solve problems with significantly longer planning horizons than previous methods

elicitation and approximately stable matching with partial preferences  97
joanna drummond craig boutilier

algorithms for stable marriage and related matching problems typically assume that full preference information is available while the gale shapley algorithm can be viewed as a means of eliciting preferences incrementally it does not prescribe a general means for matching with incomplete information nor is it designed to minimize elicitation we propose the use of maximum regret to measure the inverse degree of stability of a matching with  partial preferences minimax regret to find matchings that are maximally stable in the  presence of partial preferences and heuristic elicitation schemes that use max regret to determine relevant preference queries we show that several of our schemes find stable matchings while eliciting considerably less preference information than gale shapley and are much more appropriate in settings where approximate stability is viable

c link a hierarchical clustering approach to large scale near optimal coalition formation  106
alessandro farinelli manuele bicego sarvapali ramchurn mauro zucchelli

coalition formation is a fundamental approach to multi agent coordination in this paper we address the specific problem of coalition structure generation and focus on providing good enough solutions using a novel heuristic approach that is based on data clustering methods in particular we propose a hierarchical agglomerative clustering approach c link which uses a similarity criterion between coalitions based on the gain that the system achieves if two coalitions merge we empirically evaluate c link on a synthetic benchmark data set as well as in collective energy purchasing settings our results show that the c link approach performs very well against an optimal benchmark based on mixed integer programming achieving solutions which are in the worst case about 80 of the optimal in the synthetic data set and 98 of the optimal in the energy data set thus we show that c link can return solutions for problems involving thousands of agents within minutes

control in the presence of manipulators cooperative and competitive cases  113
zack fitzsimmons edith hemaspaandra lane a hemaspaandra

control and manipulation are two of the most studied types of attacks on elections in this paper we study the complexity of control attacks on elections in which there are manipulators we study both the case where the "chair" who is seeking to control the election is allied with the manipulators and the case where the manipulators seek to thwart the chair in the latter case we see that the order of play substantially influences the complexity we prove upper bounds holding over every election system with a polynomial time winner problem for all standard control cases and some of these bounds are at the second or third level of the polynomial hierarchy and we provide matching lower bounds to prove these tight nonetheless for important natural systems the complexity can be much lower we prove that for approval and plurality elections the complexity of even competitive clashes between a controller and manipulators falls far below those high bounds even as low as polynomial time yet we for a borda voting case show that such clashes raise the complexity unless npconp

action translation in extensive form games with large action spaces axioms paradoxes and the pseudo harmonic mapping  120
sam ganzfried tuomas sandholm

when solving extensive form games with large action spaces typically significant abstraction is needed to make the problem manageable from a modeling or computational perspective when this occurs a procedure is needed to interpret actions of the opponent that fall outside of our abstraction by mapping them to actions in our abstraction this is called an action translation mapping prior action translation mappings have been based on heuristics without theoretical justification we show that the prior mappings are highly exploitable and that most of them violate certain natural desiderata we present a new mapping that satisfies these desiderata and has significantly lower exploitability than the prior mappings furthermore we observe that the cost of this worst case performance benefit low exploitability is not high in practice our mapping performs competitively with the prior mappings against no limit texas holdem agents submitted to the 2012 annual computer poker competition we also observe several paradoxes that can arise when performing action abstraction and translation for example we show that it is possible to improve performance by including suboptimal actions in our abstraction and excluding optimal actions

bargaining for revenue shares on tree trading networks  129
arpita ghosh satyen kale kevin lang benjamin moseley

we study trade networks with a tree structure where a seller with a single indivisible good is connected to buyers each with some value for the good via a unique path of intermediaries agents in the tree make multiplicative revenue share offers to their parent nodes who choose the best offer and offer part of it to their parent and so on the winning path is determined by who finally makes the highest offer to the seller in this paper we investigate how these revenue shares might be set via a natural bargaining process between agents on the tree specifically egalitarian bargaining between endpoints of each edge in the tree we investigate the fixed point of this system of bargaining equations and prove various desirable for this solution concept including i existence ii uniqueness iii efficiency iv membership in the core v strict monotonicity vi polynomial time computability to any given accuracyfinally we present numerical evidence that asynchronous dynamics with randomly ordered updates always converges to the fixed point indicating that the fixed point shares might arise from decentralized bargaining amongst agents on the trade network

a matroid approach to the worst case allocation of indivisible goods  136
laurent gourvès jérôme monnot lydia tlilane

we consider the problem of equitably allocating a set of indivisible goods to n agents so as to maximize the utility of the least happy agent demko and hill sowed in demko s and hill t p 1988 equitable distribution of indivisible objects mathematical social sciences 162 145 158 the existence of an allocation where every agent values his share at least vnα which is a family of nonincreasing functions in a parameter α defined as the maximum value assigned by an agent to a single good a deterministic algorithm returning such an allocation in polynomial time was proposed in markakis e  psomas c a 2011 on worst case allocations in the presence of indivisible goods in workshop internet and network economics pp 278 289 springer berlin heidelberg interestingly vnα is tight for some values of α ie it is the best lower bound on the valuation of the least happy agent however it is not true for all values of α we propose a family of functions wn such that wnx ≥ vnx for all x and wnx ≥ vnx for values of x where vnx is not tight the new functions wn apply on a problem which generalizes the allocation of indivisible goods it is to find a solution base in a matroid which is common to n agents our results are constructive they are achieved by analyzing an extension of the algorithm of markakis and psomas

audience based uncertainty in abstract argument games  143
davide grossi wiebe van der hoek

the paper generalizes abstract argument games to cope with cases where proponent and opponent argue in front of an audience whose type is known only with uncertainty the generalization which makes use of basic tools from probability theory is motivated by several examples and delivers a class of abstract argument games whose adequacy is proven robust against uncertainty

optimal airline ticket purchasing using automated user guided feature selection  150
william groves maria gini

airline ticket purchase timing is a strategic problem that requires both historical data and domain knowledge to solve consistently  even with some historical information often a feature of modern travel reservation web sites it is difficult for consumers to make true cost minimizing decisions  to address this problem we introduce an automated agent which is able to optimize purchase timing on behalf of customers and provide performance estimates of its computed action policy based on past performance  we apply machine learning to recent ticket price quotes from many competing airlines for the target flight route  our novelty lies in extending this using a systematic feature extraction technique incorporating elementary user provided domain knowledge that greatly enhances the performance of machine learning algorithms  using this technique our agent achieves much closer to the optimal purchase policy than other proposed decision theoretic approaches for this domain

revenue maximization via hiding item attributes  157
mingyu guo argyrios deligkas

we study probabilistic single item second price auctions where the item is characterized by a set of attributes the auctioneer knows the actual instantiation of all the attributes but he may choose to reveal only a subset of these attributes to the bidders our model is an abstraction of the following ad auction scenario the website auctioneer knows the demographic information of its impressions and this information is in terms of a list of attributes eg age gender country of location the website may hide certain attributes from its advertisers bidders in order to create thicker market which may lead to higher revenue we study how to hide attributes in an optimal way we show that it is np hard to compute the optimal attribute hiding scheme we then derive a polynomial time solvable upper bound on the optimal revenue finally we propose two heuristic based attribute hiding schemes experiments show that revenue achieved by these schemes is close to the upper bound

opponent modelling in persuasion dialogues  164
christos hadjinikolis yiannis siantos sanjay modgil elizabeth black peter mcburney

a strategy is used by a participant in a persuasion dialogue to select locutions most likely to achieve its objective of persuading its opponent such strategies often assume that the participant has a model of its opponents which may be constructed on the basis of a participants accumulated dialogue experience however in most cases the fact that an agents experience may encode additional information which if appropriately used could increase a strategys efficiency is neglected in this work we rely on an agents experience to define a mechanism for augmenting an opponent model with information likely to be dialectally related to information already contained in it precise computation of this likelihood is exponential in the volume of related information we thus describe and evaluate an approximate approach for computing these likelihoods based on monte carlo simulation

sequential equilibrium in computational games  171
joseph y halpern rafael pass

we examine sequential equilibrium in the context of computational games halpern and pass 2011a where agents are charged forcomputation in such games an agent can rationally choose to forget so issues of imperfect recall arise in this setting we consider two notions of sequential equilibrium one is an ex ante notion where a player chooses his strategy before the game starts and is committed to it but chooses it in such a way that it remains optimal even off the equilibrium paththe second is an interim notion where a player can reconsider at each information set whether he is doing the "right" thing and if not can change his strategy the two notions agree in games of perfect recall but not in games of imperfect recall although the interim notion seems more appealing in halpern and pass2011b it is argued that there are some deep conceptual problems with it in standard games of imperfect recall we show that the conceptual problems largely disappear in the computational setting moreover in this setting under natural assumptions the two notions coincide

why is it so hard to say sorry evolution of apology with commitments in the iterated prisoners dilemma  177
the anh han luís moniz pereira francisco c santos tom lenaerts

when making a mistake individuals can apologize to secure further cooperation even if the apology is costly similarly individuals arrange commitments to guarantee that an action such as a cooperative one is in the others best interest and thus will be carried out to avoid eventual penalties for commitment failure hence both apology and commitment should go side by side in behavioral evolution here we provide a computational model showing that apologizing acts are rare in non committed interactions especially whenever cooperation is very costly and that arranging prior commitments can considerably increase the frequency of such behavior in addition we show that in both cases with or without commitments apology works only if it is sincere ie costly enough most interestingly our model predicts that individuals tend to use much costlier apology in committed relationships than otherwise because it helps better identify free riders such as fake committers "commitments bring about sincerity" furthermore we show that this strategy of apology supported by commitments outperforms the famous existent strategies of the iterated prisoners dilemma

the dynamics of reinforcement social learning in cooperative multiagent systems  184
jianye hao ho fung leung

coordination in cooperative multiagent systems is an important problem in multiagent learning literature in practical complex environments the interactions between agents can be sparse and each agents interacting partners may change frequently and randomly to this end we investigate the multiagent coordination problems in cooperative environments under the social learning framework we consider a large population of agents where each agent interacts with another agent randomly chosen from the population in each round each agent learns its policy through repeated interactions with the rest of agents via social learning it is not clear a priori if all agents can learn a consistent optimal coordination policy in such a situation we distinguish two types of learners individual action learner and joint action learner the learning performance of both learners are evaluated under a number of challenging cooperative games and the influence of the information sharing degree on the learning performance is investigated as well

macau a basis for evaluating reputation systems  191
christopher j hazard munindar p singh

reputation is a crucial concept in dynamic multiagent environments despite the large body of work on reputation systems no metrics exist to directly and quantitatively evaluate and compare them we present a common conceptual interface for reputation systems and a set of four measurable desiderata that are broadly applicable across multiple domains these desiderata employ concepts from dynamical systems theory to measure how a reputation system reacts to a strategic agent attempting to maximize its own utility we study a diverse set of well known reputation models from the literature in a moral hazard setting and identify a rich variety of characteristics that they support

how to change a groups collective decision  198
noam hazon raz lin sarit kraus

persuasion is a common social and economic activity it usually arises when conflicting interests among agents exist and one of the agents wishes to sway the opinions of others this paper considers the problem of an automated agent that needs to influence the decision of a group of self interested agents that must reach an agreement on a joint action for example consider an automated agent that aims to reduce the energy consumption of a nonresidential building by convincing a group of people who share an office to agree on an economy mode of the air conditioning and low light intensity in this paper we present four problems that address issues of minimality and safety of the persuasion process we discuss the relationships to similar problems from social choice and show that if the agents are using plurality or veto as their voting rule all of our problems are in p we also show that with k approval bucklin and borda voting rules some problems become intractable we thus present heuristics for efficient persuasion with borda and evaluate them through simulations

a game theoretic machine learning approach for revenue maximization in sponsored search  206
di he wei chen liwei wang tie yan liu

sponsored search is an important monetization channel for search engines in which an auction mechanism is used to select the ads shown to users and determine the prices charged from advertisers there have been several pieces of work in the literature that investigate how to design an auction mechanism in order to optimize the revenue of the search engine however due to some unrealistic assumptions used the practical values of these studies are not very clear in this paper we propose a novel game theoretic machine learning approach which naturally combines machine learning and game theory and learns the auction mechanism using a bilevel optimization framework in particular we first learn a markov model from historical data to describe how advertisers change their bids in response to an auction mechanism and then for any given auction mechanism we use the learnt model to predict its corresponding future bid sequences next we learn the auction mechanism through empirical revenue maximization on the predicted bid sequences we show that the empirical revenue will converge when the prediction period approaches infinity and a genetic programming algorithm can effectively optimize this empirical revenue our experiments indicate that the proposed approach is able to produce a much more effective auction mechanism than several baselines

a framework to choose trust models for different e marketplace environments  213
athirai a irissappane siwei jiang jie zhang

many trust models have been proposed to evaluate seller trustworthiness in multiagent e marketplaces their performance varies highly depending on environments where they are applied however it is challenging to choose suitable models for environments where ground truth about seller trustworthiness is unknown called unknown environments we propose a novel framework to choose suitable trust models for unknown environments based on the intuition that if a model performs well in one environment it will do so in another similar environment specifically for an unknown environment we identify a similar simulated environment with known ground truth where the trust model performing the best will be chosen as the suitable solution evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of our framework in choosing suitable trust models for different environments

defender miscoordination in security games  220
albert xin jiang ariel d procaccia yundi qian nisarg shah milind tambe

we study security games with multiple defenders to achieve maximum security defenders must perfectly synchronize their randomized allocations of resources however in real life scenarios such as protection of the port of boston this is not the case our goal is to quantify the loss incurred by miscoordination between defenders both theoretically and empirically we introduce two notions that capture this loss under different assumptions the price of miscoordination and the price of sequential commitment generally speaking our theoretical bounds indicate that the loss may be extremely high in the worst case while our simulations establish a smaller yet significant loss in practice

a social welfare optimal sequential allocation procedure  227
thomas kalinowski nina narodytska toby walsh

we consider a simple sequential allocation procedure for sharing indivisible items between agents in which agents take turns to pick items supposing additive utilities and independence between the agents we show that the expected utility of each agent is computable in polynomial time using this result we prove that the expected utilitarian social welfare is maximized when agents take alternate turns we also argue that this mechanism remains optimal when agents behave strategically

an intelligent broker agent for energy trading an mdp approach  234
rodrigue t kuate minghua he maria chli hai h wang

this paper details the development and evaluation of astontac an energy broker that successfully participated in the 2012 power trading agent competition power tac astontac buys electrical energy from the wholesale market and sells it in the retail market the main focus of the paper is on the brokers bidding strategy in the wholesale market in particular it employs markov decision processes mdp to purchase energy at low prices in a day ahead power wholesale market and keeps energy supply and demand balanced moreover we explain how the agent uses non homogeneous hidden markov model nhhmm to forecast energy demand and price an evaluation and analysis of the 2012 power tac finals show that astontac is the only agent that can buy energy at low price in the wholesale market and keep energy imbalance low

agent failures in all pay auctions  241
yoad lewenberg omer lev yoram bachrach jeffrey s rosenschein

all pay auctions a common mechanism for various human and agent interactions suffers like many other mechanisms from the possibility of players failure to participate in the auction we model such failures and show how they affect the equilibrium state revealing various properties such as the lack of influence of the most likely to participate player on the behavior of the other players we perform this analysis with two scenarios the sum profit model where the auctioneer obtains the sum of all submitted bids and the max profit model of crowdsourcing contests where the auctioneer can only use the best submissions and thus obtains only the winning bid furthermore we examine various methods of influencing the probability of participation such as the effects of misreporting ones own probability of participating and how influencing another players participation chances eg sabotage changes the players strategy

efficient learning in linearly solvable mdp models  248
ang li paul r schrater

linearly solvable markov decision process mdp models are a powerful subclass of problems with a simple structure that allow the policy to be written directly in terms of the uncontrolled passive dynamics of the environment and the goals of the agent however there have been no learning algorithms for this class of models in this research we develop a robust learning approach to linearly solvable mdps to exploit the simple solution for general problems we show how to construct passive dynamics from any transition matrix use bayesian updating to estimate the model parameters and apply approximate and efficient bayesian exploration to speed learning in addition we reduce the computational cost of learning using intermittent bayesian updating and policy solving we also gave a polynomial theoretical time complexity bound for the convergence of our learning algorithm and demonstrate a linear bound for the subclass of the reinforcement learning problems with the property that the transition error depends only on the agent itself test results for our algorithm in a grid world are presented comparing our algorithm with the beb algorithm the results showed that our algorithm learned more than the beb algorithm without losing convergence speed so that the advantage of our algorithm increased as the environment got more complex we also showed that our algorithms performance is more stable after convergence finally we show how to apply our approach to the cellular telephones problem by defining the passive dynamics

game theoretic question selection for tests  254
yuqian li vincent conitzer

conventionally the questions on a test are assumed to be kept secret from test takers until the test  however for tests that are taken on a large scale particularly asynchronously this is very hard to achieve for example example toefl ibt and drivers license test questions are easily found online  this also appears likely to become an issue for massive open online courses moocs in this paper we take the loss of confidentiality as a fact  even so not all hope is lost as the test taker can memorize only a limited set of questions answers and the tester can randomize which questions appear on the test  we model this as a stackelberg game where the tester commits to a mixed strategy and the follower responds  we provide an exponential size linear program formulation prove several np hardness results and give efficient algorithms for special cases

multi winner social choice with incomplete preferences  263
tyler lu craig boutilier

multi winner social choice considers the problem of selecting a slate of k options to realize some social objective it has found application in the construction of political legislatures and committees product recommendation and related problems and has recently attracted attention from a computational perspective we address the multi winner problem when facing incomplete voter preferences using the notion of minimax regret to determine a robust slate of options in the presence of preference uncertainty we analyze the complexity of this problem and develop new exact and greedy robust optimization algorithms for its solution using these techniques we also develop preference elicitation heuristics which in practice allow us to find near optimal slates with considerable savings in the preference information required vis a vis complete votes

an ambiguity aversion framework of security game under ambiguities  271
wenjun ma xudong luo weiru liu

security is a critical concern around the world since resources for security are always limited lots of interest have arisen in using game theory to handle security resource allocation problems however most of the existing work does not address adequately how a defender chooses his optimal strategy in a game with absent inaccurate uncertain and even ambiguous strategy profiles payoffs to address this issue we propose a general framework of security games under ambiguities based on dempster shafer theory and the ambiguity aversion principle of minimax regret then we reveal some properties of this framework also we present two methods to reduce the influence of complete ignorance our investigation shows that this new framework is better in handling security resource allocation problems under ambiguities

multi agent team formation diversity beats strength  279
leandro soriano marcolino albert xin jiang milind tambe

team formation is a critical step in deploying a multi agent team in some scenarios agents coordinate by voting continuously when forming such teams should we focus on the diversity of the team or on the strength of each member can a team of diverse and weak agents outperform a uniform team of strong agents we propose a new model to address these questions our key contributions include i we show that a diverse team can overcome a uniform team and we give the necessary conditions for it to happen ii we present optimal voting rules for a diverse team iii we perform synthetic experiments that demonstrate that both diversity and strength contribute to the performance of a team iv we show experiments that demonstrate the usefulness of our model in one of the most difficult challenges for artificial intelligence computer go

control complexity of schulze voting  286
curtis menton preetjot singh

schulze voting is a recently introduced voting system enjoying unusual popularity and a high degree of real world use with users including the wikimedia foundation several branches of the pirate party and mtv it is a condorcet voting system that determines the winners of an election using information about paths in a graph representation of the election we resolve the complexity of many electoral control cases for schulze voting we find that it falls short of the best known voting systems in terms of control resistance demonstrating vulnerabilities of concern to some prospective users of the system

computational analysis of connectivity games with applications to the investigation of terrorist networks  293
tomasz p michalak talal rahwan nicholas r jennings piotr l szczepanski oskar skibski ramasuri narayanam michael j wooldridge

we study a recently developed centrality metric to identify key players in terrorist organisations due to lindelauf et al 2011 this metric which involves computation of the shapley value for connectivity games on graphs proposed by amer and gimenez 2004 was shown to produce substantially better results than previously used standard centralities in this paper we present the first computational analysis of this class of coalitional games and propose two algorithms for computing lindelauf et als centrality metric our first algorithm is exact and runs in time linear by number of connected subgraphs in the network as shown in the numerical simulations our algorithm identifies key players in the wtc 911 terrorist network constructed of 36 members and 125 links in less than 40 minutes in contrast a general purpose shapley value algorithm would require weeks to solve this problem our second algorithm is approximate and can be used to study much larger networks

optimal decentralized decision making in a team of cooperative agents as formalized by decentralized pomdps is a notoriously hard problem a major obstacle is that the agents do not have access to a sufficient statistic during execution which means that they need to base their actions on their histories of observations a consequence is that even during off line planning the choice of decision rules for different stages is tightly interwoven decisions of earlier stages affect how to act optimally at later stages and the optimal value function for a stage is known to have a dependence on the decisions made up to that point this paper makes a contribution to the theory of decentralized pomdps by showing how this dependence on the past joint policy can be replaced by a sufficient statistic these results are extended to the case of k step delayed communication the paper investigates the practical implications as well as the effectiveness of a new pruning technique for maa methods in a number of benchmark problems and discusses future avenues of research opened by these contributions

joel oren yuval filmus craig boutilier

top k voting is an especially natural form of partial vote elicitation in which only length k prefixes of rankings are elicited we analyze the ability of top k vote elicitation to correctly determine true winners with high probability given probabilistic models of voter preferences and candidate availability we provide bounds on the minimal value of k required to determine the correct winner under the plurality and borda voting rules considering both worst case preference profiles and profiles drawn from the impartial culture and mallows probabilistic models we also derive conditions under which the special case of zero elicitation ie k  0 produces the correct winner we provide empirical results that confirm the value of top k voting

a proof theoretical view of collective rationality  317
daniele porello

the impossibility results in judgement aggregation show a clash between fair aggregation procedures and rational collective outcomes in this paper we are interested in analysing the notion of rational outcome by proposing a proof theoretical understanding of collective rationality in particular we use the analysis of proofs and inferences provided by linear logic in order to define a fine grained notion of group reasoning that allows for studying collective rationality with respect to a number of logics we analyse the well known paradoxes in judgement aggregation and we pinpoint the reasoning steps that trigger the inconsistencies moreover we extend the map of possibility and impossibility results in judgement aggregation by discussing the case of substructural logics in particular we show that there exist fragments of linear logic for which general possibility results can be obtained

talal rahwan tri dung nguyen tomasz p michalak maria polukarov madalina croitoru nicholas r jennings

we introduce a new representation scheme for coalitional games called coalition flow networks cf nets where the formation of effective coalitions in a task based setting is reduced to the problem of directing flow through a network we show that our representation is intuitive fully expressive and captures certain patterns in a significantly more concise manner compared to the conventional approach furthermore our representation has the flexibility to express various classes of games such as characteristic function games coalitional games with overlapping coalitions and coalitional games with agent types as such to the best of our knowledge cf nets is the first representation that allows for switching conveniently and efficiently between overlappingnon overlapping coalitions withwithout agent types we demonstrate the efficiency of our scheme on the coalition structure generation problem where near optimal solutions for large instances can be found in a matter of seconds

opponent models with uncertainty for strategic argumentation  332
tjitze rienstra matthias thimm nir oren

this paper deals with the issue of strategic argumentation in the setting of dung style abstract argumentation theory such reasoning takes place through the use of opponent models—recursive representations of an agents knowledge and beliefs regarding the opponents knowledge using such models we present three approaches to reasoning the first directly utilises the opponent model to identify the best move to advance in a dialogue the second extends our basic approach through the use of quantitative uncertainty over the opponents model the final extension introduces virtual arguments into the opponents reasoning process such arguments are unknown to the agent but presumed to exist and interact with known arguments they are therefore used to add a primitive notion of risk to the agents reasoning we have implemented our models and we have performed an empirical analysis that shows that this added expressivity improves the performance of an agent in a dialogue

efficient interdependent value combinatorial auctions with single minded bidders  339
valentin robu david c parkes takayuki ito nicholas r jennings

we study the problem of designing efficient auctions where bidders have interdependent values ie values that depend on the signals of other agents we consider a contingent bid model in which agents can explicitly condition the value of their bids on the bids submitted by others in particular we adopt a linear contingent bidding model for single minded combinatorial auctions cas in which submitted bids are linear combinations of bids received from others we extend the existing state of the art by identifying constraints on the interesting bundles and contingency weights reported by the agents which allow the efficient second priced fixed point bids auction to be implemented in single minded cas moreover for domains in which the required single crossing condition fails which characterizes when efficient ic auctions are possible we design a two stage mechanism in which a subset of agents experts" are allocated first using their reports to allocate the remaining items to the other agents

efficiently solving joint activity based security games  346
eric shieh manish jain albert xin jiang milind tambe

despite recent successful real world deployments of stackelberg security games ssgs scale up remains a fundamental challenge in this field the latest techniques do not scale up to domains where multiple defenders must coordinate time dependent joint activities to address this challenge this paper presents two branch and price algorithms for solving ssgs smarto and smarth with three novel features i a column generation approach that uses an ordered network of nodes determined by solving the traveling salesman problem to generate individual defender strategies ii exploitation of iterative reward shaping of multiple coordinating defender units to generate coordinated strategies iii generation of tighter upper bounds for pruning by solving security games that only abide by key scheduling constraints we provide extensive experimental results and formal analyses

bimodal switching for online planning in multiagent settings  360
ekhlas sonu prashant doshi

we present a bimodal method for online planning in partially observable multiagent settings as formalized by a finitely nested interactive partially observable markov decision process i pomdp an agent planning in an environment shared with another updates beliefs both over the physical state and the other agents models in problems where we do not observe others action explicitly but must infer it from sensing its effect on the state observations are more informative about the other when the belief over the state space has reduced uncertainty for typical uncertain initial beliefs we model the agent as if it were acting alone and utilize fast online planning for pomdps subsequently the agent switches to online planning in multiagent settings we maintain tight lower and upper bounds at each step and switch over when the difference between them reduces to less than ε

analysis and optimization of multi dimensional percentile mechanisms  367
xin sui craig boutilier tuomas sandholm

we consider the mechanism design problem for agents with single peaked preferences over multi dimensional domains when multiple alternatives can be chosen facility location and committee selection are classic embodiments of this problem we propose a class of percentile mechanisms a form of generalized median mechanisms that are strategy proof and derive worst case approximation ratios for social cost and maximum load for l1 and l2 cost models more importantly we propose a sample based framework for optimizing the choice of percentiles relative to any prior distribution over preferences while maintaining strategy proofness our empirical investigations using social cost and maximum load as objectives demonstrate the viability of this approach and the value of such optimized mechanisms vis a vis mechanisms derived through worst case analysis

multi dimensional single peaked consistency and its approximations  375
xin sui alex francois nienaber craig boutilier

single peakedness is one of the most commonly used domain restrictions in social choice however the extent to which agent preferences are single peaked in practice and the extent to which recent proposals for approximate single peakedness can further help explain voter preferences is unclear in this article we assess the ability of both single dimensional and multi dimensional approximations to explain preference profiles drawn from several real world elections we develop a simple branch and bound algorithm that finds multi dimensional single peaked axes that best fit a given profile and which works with several forms of approximation empirical results on two election data sets show that preferences in these elections are far from single peaked in any one dimensional space but are nearly single peaked in two dimensions our algorithms are reasonably efficient in practice and also show excellent anytime performance

an efficient vector based representation for coalitional games  383
long tran thanh tri dung nguyen talal rahwan alex rogers nicholas r jennings

we propose a new representation for coalitional games called the coalitional skill vector model where there is a set of skills in the system and each agent has a skill vector — a vector consisting of values that reflect the agents level in different skills furthermore there is a set of goals each with requirements expressed in terms of the minimum skill level necessary to achieve the goal agents can form coalitions to aggregate their skills and achieve goals otherwise unachievable we show that this representation is fully expressive that is it can represent any characteristic function game we also show that for some interesting classes of games our representation is significantly more compact than the classical representation and facilitates the development of efficient algorithms to solve the coalition structure generation problem as well as the problem of computing the core andor the least core we also demonstrate that by using the coalitional skill vector representation our solver can handle up to 500 agents

endogenous boolean games  390
paolo turrini

in boolean games players exercise control over propositional variables and strive to achieve a goal formula whose realization might require the opponents cooperation recently a theory of incentive engineering for such games has been devised where an external authority steers the outcome of the game towards certain desirable properties consistent with players goals by imposing a taxation mechanism on the players that makes the outcomes that do not comply with those properties less appealing to them the present contribution stems from a complementary perspective and studies instead how boolean games can be transformed from inside rather than from outside by endowing players with the possibility of sacrificing a part of their payoff received at a certain outcome in order to convince other players to play a certain strategy what we call here endogenous boolean games ebgs boils down to enriching the framework of boolean games with the machinery of side payments coming from game theory we analyze equilibria in ebgs showing the preconditions needed for desirable outcomes to be achieved without external intervention finally making use of taxation mechanism we show how to transform an ebg in such a way that desirable outcomes can be realized independently of side payments

monte carlo expectation maximization for dec pomdps  397
feng wu shlomo zilberstein nicholas r jennings

we address two significant drawbacks of state of the art solvers of decentralized pomdps dec pomdps the reliance on complete knowledge of the model and limited scalability as the complexity of the domain grows we extend a recently proposed approach for solving dec pomdps via a reduction to the maximum likelihood problem which in turn can be solved using em we introduce a model free version of this approach that employs monte carlo emmcem while a naive implementation of mcem is inadequate in multi agent settings we introduce several improvements in sampling that produce high quality results on a variety of dec pomdp benchmarks including large problems with thousands of agents

scaling up security games with boundedly rational adversaries a cutting plane approach  404
rong yang albert xin jiang milind tambe fernando ordóñez

to improve the current real world deployments of stackelberg security games ssgs it is critical now to efficiently incorporate models of adversary bounded rationality in large scale ssgs unfortunately previously proposed branch and price approaches fail to scale up given the non convexity of such models as we show with a  realization called cocomo  therefore we next present a novel cutting plane algorithm called blade to scale up ssgs with complex adversary models with three key novelties i an efficient scalable separation oracle to generate deep cuts ii a heuristic that uses gradient to further improve the cuts iii techniques for quality efficiency tradeoff

automated generation of interaction graphs for value factored decentralized pomdps  411
william yeoh akshat kumar shlomo zilberstein

the decentralized partially observable markov decision process dec pomdp is a powerful model for multi agent planning under uncertainty but its applicability is hindered by its high complexity    solving dec pomdps optimally is nexp hard recently kumar et al introduced the value factorization vf framework which exploits decomposable value functions that can be factored into subfunctions this framework has been shown to be a generalization of several models that leverage sparse agent interactions such as ti dec mdps nd pomdps and td pomdps existing algorithms for these models assume that the interaction graph of the problem is given in this paper we introduce three algorithms to automatically generate interaction graphs for models within the vf framework and establish lower and upper bounds on the expected reward of an optimal joint policy we illustrate experimentally the benefits of these techniques for sensor placement in a decentralized tracking application

a reputation management approach for resource constrained trustee agents  418
han yu chunyan miao bo an cyril leung victor r lesser

trust is an important mechanism enabling agents to self police open and dynamic multi agent systems odmass trusters evaluate the reputation of trustees based on their past observed performance and use this information to guide their future interaction decisions existing trust models tend to concentrate trusters interactions on a small number of highly reputable trustees to minimize risk exposure when a trustees servicing capacity is limited such an approach may cause long delays for trusters and subsequently damage the reputation of trustees to mitigate this problem we propose a reputation management approach for trustee agents based on distributed constraint optimization it helps a trustee to make situation aware decisions on which incoming requests to serve and prevent the resulting reputation score from being affected by factors out of the trustees control the approach is evaluated through theoretical analysis and within a simulated highly dynamic multi agent environment the results show that it can achieve close to optimally efficient utilization of the trustee agents collective capacity in an odmas promotes fair treatment of trustee agents based on their behavior and significantly outperforms related work in enhancing social welfare

multiwinner elections under preferences that are single peaked on a tree  425
lan yu hau chan edith elkind

we study the complexity of electing a committee under several variants of the chamberlin–courant rule when the voters preferences are single peaked on a tree we first show that this problem is easy for the egalitarian or "minimax" version of this problem for arbitrary trees and misrepresentation functions for the standard utilitarian version of this problem we provide an algorithm for an arbitrary misrepresentation function whose running time is polynomial in the input size as long as the number of leaves of the underlying tree is bounded by a constant on the other hand we prove that our problem remains computationally hard on trees that have bounded degree diameter or path width finally we show how to modify tricks 1989 algorithm to check whether an election is single peaked on a tree whose number of leaves does not exceed a given parameter

on random quotas and proportional representation in weighted voting games  432
yair zick

weighted voting games wvgs model decision making bodies such as parliaments and councils in such settings it is often important to provide a measure of the influence a player has on the vote two highly popular such measures are the shapley shubik power index and the banzhaf power index given a power measure proportional representation is the property of having players voting power proportional to the number of parliament seats they receive approximate proportional representation wrt the banzhaf power index can be ensured by changing the number of parliament seats each party receives this is known as penroses square root method however a discrepancy between player weights and parliament seats is often undesirable or unfeasible a simpler way of achieving approximate proportional representation is by changing the quota ie the number of votes required in order to pass a bill it is known that a players shapley shubik power index is proportional to his weight when one chooses a quota at random that is when taking a random quota proportional representation holds in expectation in our work we show that not only does proportional representation hold in expectation it also holds for many quotas we do so by providing bounds on the variance of the shapley value when the quota is chosen at random assuming certain weight distributions we further explore the case where weights are sampled from iid binomial distributions for this case we show good bounds on an important parameter governing the behavior of the variance as well as substantiating our claims with empirical analysis

robust constraint satisfaction and local hidden variables in quantum mechanics  440
samson abramsky georg gottlob phokion g kolaitis

motivated by considerations in quantum mechanics we introduce the class of robust constraint satisfaction problems in which the question is whether every partial assignment of a certain length can be extended to a solution provided the partial assignment does not violate any of the constraints of the given instance we explore the complexity of specific robust colorability and robust satisfiability problems and show that they are np complete we then use these results to establish the computational intractability of detecting local hidden variable models in quantum mechanics

just in time compilation of knowledge bases  447
gilles audemard jean marie lagniez laurent simon

since the first principles of knowledge compilation kc most of the work has been focused in finding a good compilation target language in terms of compromises between compactness and expressiveness the central idea remained unchanged in the last fifteen years an off line very hard stage allows to "compile" the initial theory in order to guarantee theoretically an efficient on line stage on a set of predefined queries and operations  we propose a new "just in time" approach for kc here any knowledge base kb will be immediately available for queries and the effort spent on past queries will be partly amortized for future ones  to guarantee efficient answers we rely on the tremendous progresses made in the practical solving of sat and incremental sat applicative problems even if each query may be theoretically hard we  show that our approach outperforms previous kc approaches on the set of classical problems used in the field and allows to handle problems that are out of the scope of current approaches 

maintaining alternative values in constraint based configuration  454
caroline becker hélène fargier

constraint programming techniques are widely used to model and solve interactive decision problems and especially configuration problems in this type of application the configurable product is described by means of a set of constraints bearing on the configuration variables the user interactively solves the csp by assigning the variables according to her preferences the system then has to keep the domains of the other variables consistent with these choices since maintaining the global inverse consistency of the domains is not tractable the domains are instead filtered according to some level of local consistency eg arc consistency the present paper aims at offering a more convenient interaction by providing the user with possible alternative values for the already assigned variables ie values that could replace the current ones without leading to a constraint violation we thus present the new concept of alternative domains in a possibly partially assigned csp we propose a propagation algorithm that computes all the alternative domains in a single step its worst case complexity is comparable to the one of the naive algorithm that would run a full propagation for each variable but its experimental efficiency is better

detecting and exploiting subproblem tractability  468
christian bessiere clement carbonnel emmanuel hebrard george katsirelos toby walsh

constraint satisfaction problems may be nearly tractable for instance most of the relations in a problem might belong to a tractable language we introduce a method to take advantage of this fact by computing a backdoor to this tractable language the method can be applied to many tractable classes for which the membership test is itself tractable we introduce therefore two polynomial membership testing algorithms to check if a language is closed under a majority or conservative maltsev polymorphism respectively then we show that computing a minimal backdoor for such classes is fixed parameter tractable fpt if the tractable subset of relations is given and w2 complete otherwise finally we report experimental results on the xcsp benchmark set we identified a few promising problem classes where problems were nearly closed under a majority polymorphism and small backdoors could be computed

constraint acquisition via partial queries  475
christian bessiere remi coletta emmanuel hebrard george katsirelos nadjib lazaar nina narodytska claude guy quimper toby walsh

geoffrey chu serge gaspers nina narodytska andreas schutt toby walsh

we investigate the computational complexity of two global constraints cumulative and interdistance these are key constraints in modeling and solving scheduling problems enforcing domain consistency on both is np hard however restricted versions of these constraints are often sufficient in practice some examples include scheduling problems with a large number of similar tasks or tasks sparsely distributed over time another example is runway sequencing problems in air traffic control where landing periods have a regular pattern such cases can be characterized in terms of structural restrictions on the constraints we identify a number of such structural restrictions and investigate how they impact the computational complexity of propagating these global constraints in particular we prove that such restrictions often make propagation tractable

michael codish alice miller patrick prosser peter j stuckey

there are many complex combinatorial problems which involve searching for an undirected graph satisfying a certain property these problems are often highly challenging because of the large number of isomorphic representations of a possible solution in this paper we introduce novel effective and compact symmetry breaking constraints for undirected graph search while incomplete these prove highly beneficial in pruning the search for a graph we illustrate the application of symmetry breaking in graph representation to resolve several open instances in extremal graph theory

david a cohen martin c cooper guillaume escamocher stanislav Živný

a variable elimination rule allows the polynomial time identification of certain variables whose elimination does not affect the satisfiability of an instance variable elimination in the constraint satisfaction problem csp can be used in preprocessing or during search to reduce search space size we show that there are essentially just four variable elimination rules defined by forbidding generic sub instances known as irreducible patterns in arc consistent csp instances one of these rules is the broken triangle property whereas the other three are novel

weight enhanced diversification in stochastic local search for satisfiability  524
thach thao duong duc nghia pham abdul sattar m a hakim newton

intensification and diversification are the key factors that control the performance of stochastic local search in satisfiability sat recently novelty walk has become a popular method for improving diversification of the search and so has been integrated in many well known sat solvers such as tnm and gnovelty in this paper we introduce new heuristics to improve the effectiveness of novelty walk in terms of reducing search stagnation in particular we use weights based on statistical information collected during the search to focus the diversification phase onto specific areas of interest with a given probability we select the most frequently unsatisfied clause instead of a totally random one as novelty walk does amongst all the variables appearing in the selected clause we then select the least flipped variable for the next move our experimental results show that the new weight enhanced diversification method significantly improves the performance of gnovelty and thus outperforms other local search sat solvers on a wide range of structured and random satisfiability benchmarks

mnacho echenim nicolas peltier sophie tourret

abduction has been extensively studied in propositional logic because of its many applications in artificial intelligence however its intrinsic complexity has been a limitation to the implementation of abductive reasoning tools in more expressive logics we have devised such a tool in ground flat equational logic in which literals are equations or disequations between constants our tool is based on the computation of prime implicates it uses a relaxed paramodulation calculus designed to generate all prime implicates of a formula together with a carefully defined data structure storing the implicates and able to efficiently detect and remove redundancies in addition to a detailed description of this method we present an analysis of some experimental results

dominance rules for the choquet integral in multiobjective dynamic programming  538
lucie galand julien lesca patrice perny

multiobjective dynamic programming modp is a general problem solving method used to determine the set of pareto optimal solutions in optimization problems involving discrete decision variables and multiple objectives it applies to combinatorial problems in which pareto optimality of a solution extends to all its sub solutions bellman principle in this paper we focus on the determination of the preferred tradeoffs in the pareto set where preference is measured by a choquet integral this model provides high descriptive possibilities but the associated preferences generally do not meet the bellman principle thus preventing any straightforward adaptation of modp to overcome this difficulty we introduce here a general family of dominance rules enabling an early pruning of some pareto optimal sub solutions that cannot lead to a choquet optimum within this family we identify the most efficient dominance rules and show how they can be incorporated into a modp algorithm then we report numerical tests showing the actual efficiency of this approach to find choquet optimal tradeoffs in multiobjective knapsack problems

gianluigi greco francesco scarcello

an extension of the csp optimization framework tailored to identify fair solutions to instances involving multiple optimization functions is studied two settings are considered based on the maximization of the minimum value over all the given functions max min approach and on its lexicographical refinement where over all solutions maximizing the minimum value those maximizing the second minimum value are preferred and so on until all functions are considered lexmax min approach for both settings the complexity of computing an optimal solution is analyzed and the tractability frontier is charted for acyclic instances wrt the number and the domains of the functions to be optimized larger islands of tractability are then identified via a novel structural approach based on a notion of guard that is designed to deal with the interactions among constraint scopes and optimization functions

Éric grégoire jean marie lagniez bertrand mazure

this paper is about transforming constraint networks to accommodate additional constraints in specific ways the focus is on two intertwined issues first we investigate how partial solutions to an initial network can be preserved from the potential impact of additional constraints second we study how more permissive constraints which are intended to enlarge the set of solutions can be accommodated in a constraint network these two problems are studied in the general case and the light is shed on their relationship a case study is then investigated where a more permissive additional constraint is taken into account through a form of network relaxation while some previous partial solutions are preserved at the same time

sufficiency based selection strategy for mcts  559
stefan freyr gudmundsson yngvi björnsson

monte carlo tree search mcts has proved a remarkably effective decision mechanism in many different game domains including computer go and general game playing ggp  however in ggp where many disparate games are played certain type of games have proved to be particularly problematic for mcts  one of the problems are game trees with so called optimistic moves that is bad moves that superficially look good but potentially require much simulation effort to prove otherwise  such scenarios can be difficult to identify in real time and can lead to suboptimal or even harmful decisions in this paper we investigate a selection strategy for mcts to alleviate this problem the strategy called sufficiency threshold concentrates simulation effort better for resolving potential optimistic move scenarios  the improved strategy is evaluated empirically in an n arm bandit test domain for highlighting its properties as well as in a state of the art ggp agent to demonstrate its effectiveness in practice  the new strategy shows significant improvements in both domains

this paper presents a new dcop algorithm calleddeqed decomposition with quadratic encoding to decentralize deqed is based on the divide and coordinate dac framework where the agents repeatedly solve their updated local subproblems the divide stage and exchange coordination information that causes them to update their local sub problems the coordinate stage unlike other dac based dcop algorithms deqed does not essentially increase the complexity of local subproblems and allows agents to avoid exchanging primal variable values in the coordinate stage our experimental results show that deqed significantly outperformed other incomplete dcop algorithms for both random and structured instances

extending simple tabular reduction with short supports  573
christopher jefferson peter nightingale

constraint propagation is one of the key techniques in constraint programming and a large body of work has built up around it special purpose constraint propagation algorithms frequently make implicit use of short supports — by examining a subset of the variables they can infer support a justification that a variable value pair still forms part of a solution to the constraint for all other variables and values and save substantial work recently short supports have been used in general purpose propagators and when the constraint is amenable to short supports speed ups of more than three orders of magnitude have been demonstrated in this paper we present shortstr2 a development of the simple tabular reduction algorithm str2 we show that shortstr2 is complementary to the existing algorithms shortgac and haggisgac that exploit short supports while being much simpler when a constraint is amenable to short supports the short support set can be exponentially smaller than the full length support set therefore shortstr2 can efficiently propagate many constraints that str2 cannot even load into memory we also show that shortstr2 can be combined with a simple algorithm to identify short supports from full length supports to provide a superior drop in replacement for str2

we present the first polynomial time construction procedure for generating graceful double wheel graphs a graph is graceful if its vertices can be labeled with distinct integer values from 0  e where e is the number of edges such that each edge has a unique value corresponding to the absolute difference of its endpoints graceful graphs have a range of practical application domains including in radio astronomy x ray crystallography cryptography and experimental design various families of graphs have been proven to be graceful while others have only been conjectured to be in particular it has been conjectured that so called double wheel graphs are graceful a double wheel graph consists of two cycles of n nodes connected to a common hub we prove this conjecture by providing the first construction for graceful double wheel graphs for any n  3 using a framework that combines streamlined constraint reasoning with insights from human computation we also use this framework to provide a polynomial time construction for diagonally ordered magic squares

the number partitioning problem seeks to divide a set of n numbers across k distinct subsets so as to minimize the sum of the largest partition in this work we develop a new optimal algorithm for multi way number partitioning a critical observation motivating our methodology is that a globally optimal k way partition may be recursively constructed by obtaining suboptimal solutions to subproblems of size k – 1 we introduce a new principle of optimality that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for this construction and use it to strengthen the relationship between sequential decompositions by enforcing upper and lower bounds on intermediate solutions we also demonstrate how to further prune unpromising partial assignments by detecting and eliminating dominated solutions our approach outperforms the previous state of the art by up to four orders of magnitude reducing average runtime on the largest benchmarks from several hours to less than a second

three generalizations of the focus constraint  630
nina narodytska thierry petit mohamed siala toby walsh

the focus constraint expresses the notion that solutions are concentrated in practice this constraint suffers from the rigidity of its semantics to tackle this issue we propose three generalizations of the focus constraint we provide for each one a complete filtering algorithm as well as discussing decompositions

subset selection of search heuristics  637
chris rayner nathan sturtevant michael bowling

constructing a strong heuristic function is a central problem in heuristic search a common approach is to combine a number of heuristics by maximizing over the values from each if a limit is placed on this number then a subset selection problem arises we treat this as an optimization problem and proceed by translating a natural loss function into a submodular and monotonic utility function under which greedy selection is guaranteed to be near optimal we then extend this approach with a sampling scheme that retains provable optimality our empirical results show large improvements over existing methods and give new insight into building heuristics for directed domains

semiring based mini bucket partitioning schemes  644
emma rollon javier larrosa rina dechter

graphical models are one of the most prominent frameworks to model complex systems and efficiently query them their underlying algebraic properties are captured by a valuation structure that most usually is a semiring depending on the semiring of choice we can capture probabilistic models constraint networks cost networks etc in this paper we address the partitioning problem which occurs in many approximation techniques such as mini bucket elimination and join graph propagation algorithms roughly speaking subject to complexity bounds the algorithm needs to find a partition of a set of factors such that best approximates the whole set while this problem has been addressed in the past in a particular case we present here a general description furthermore we also propose a  general partitioning scheme our proposal is general in the sense that it is  presented in terms of a generic semiring with the only additional requirements of a division operation and a refinement of its order the proposed algorithm  instantiates to the particular task of computing the probability of evidence but also applies directly to other important reasoning tasks we demonstrate its good empirical behaviour on the problem of computing the most probable explanation

improved bin completion for optimal bin packing and number partitioning  651
ethan l schreiber richard e korf

the bin packing problem is to partition a multiset of n numbers into as few bins of capacity c as possible such that the sum of the numbers in each bin does not exceed c we compare two existing algorithms for solving this problem bin completion bc and branch and cut and price bcp we show experimentally that the problem difficulty and dominant algorithm are a function of n the precision of the input elements and the number of bins in an optimal solution we describe three improvements to bc which result in a speedup of up to five orders of magnitude as compared to the original bc algorithm while the current belief is that bcp is the dominant bin packing algorithm we show that improved bc is up to five orders of magnitude faster than a state of the art bcp algorithm on problems with relatively few bins we then explore a closely related problem the number partitioning problem and show that an algorithm based on improved bin packing is up to three orders of magnitude faster than a bcp solver called dimm which claims to be state of the art finally we show how to use number partitioning to generate difficult bin packing instances

forward perimeter search with controlled use of memory  659
thorsten schütt robert döbbelin alexander reinefeld

there are many hard shortest path search problems that cannot be solved because best first search runs out of memory space and depth first search runs out of time we propose forward perimeter search fps a heuristic search with controlled use of memory it builds a perimeter around the root node and tests each perimeter node for a shortest path to the goal the perimeter is adaptively extended towards the goal during the search process we show that fps expands in random 24 puzzles 50 fewer nodes than bf ida while requiring several orders of magnitude less memory additionally we present a hard problem instance of the 24 puzzle that needs at least 140 moves to solve ie 26 more moves than the previously published hardest instance

minimizing writes in parallel external memory search  666
nathan r sturtevant matthew j rutherford

recent research on external memory search has shown that disks can be effectively used as secondary storage when performing large breadth first searches we introduce the write minimizing breadth first search wmbfs algorithm which is designed to minimizethe number of writes performed in an external memory bfs wmbfs is also designed to store the results of the bfs for later usewe present the results of a bfs on a single agent version of chinese checkers and the rubiks cube edge cubes state spaces with about 1 trillion states each in evaluating against a comparable approach wmbfs reduces the io for the chinese checkers domain by over an order of magnitude in rubiks cube in addition to reducing io the search is also 35 times faster analysis of the results suggests the machine and state space properties necessary for wmbfs to perform well

towards rational deployment of multiple heuristics in a  674
david tolpin tal beja solomon eyal shimony ariel felner erez karpas

the obvious way to use several admissible heuristics in a is to take their maximum in this paper we aim to reduce the time spent on computing heuristics we discuss lazy a a variant of a where heuristics are evaluated lazily only when they are essential to a decision to be made in the a search process we present a new rational meta reasoning based scheme rational lazy a which decides whether to compute the more expensive heuristics at all based on a myopic value of information estimate both methods are examined theoretically empirical evaluation on several domains supports the theoretical results and shows that lazy a and rational lazy a are state of the art heuristic combination methods

a unified approximate nearest neighbor search scheme by combining data structure and hashing  681
debing zhang genmao yang yao hu zhongming jin deng cai xiaofei he

nowadays nearest neighbor search becomes more and more important when facing the challenge of big data traditionally to solve this problem researchers mainly focus on building effective data structures such as hierarchical k means tree or using hashing methods to accelerate the query process in this paper we propose a novel unified approximate nearest neighbor search scheme to combine the advantages of both the effective data structure and the fast hamming distance computation in hashing methods in this way the searching procedure can be further accelerated computational complexity analysis and extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed scheme
knowledge representation reasoning and logic

verifiable equilibria in boolean games  689
thomas Ågotnes paul harrenstein wiebe van der hoek michael wooldridge

this work is motivated by the following concern suppose we have a game exhibiting multiple nash equilibria with little to distinguish them except that one of them can be verified while the others cannot that is one of these equilibria carries sufficient information that if this is the outcome then the players can tell that an equilibrium has been played this provides an argument for this equilibrium being played instead of the alternatives verifiability can thus serve to make an equilibrium a focal point in the game we formalise and investigate this concept using a model of boolean games with incomplete information we define and investigate three increasingly strong types of verifiable equilibria characterise the complexity of checking these and show how checking their existence can be captured in a variant of modal epistemic logic

efficient approach to solve the minimal labeling problem of temporal and spatial qualitative constraints  696
nouhad amaneddine jean françois condotta michael sioutis

the interval algebra ia and a subset of the region connection calculus rcc namely rcc 8 are the dominant artificial intelligence approaches for representing and reasoning about qualitative temporal and topological relations respectively such qualitative information can be formulated as a qualitative constraint network qcn in this paper we focus on the minimal labeling problem mlp and we propose an algorithm to efficiently derive all the feasible base relations of a qcn our algorithm considers chordal qcns and a new form of partial consistency further the proposed algorithm uses tractable subclasses of relations having a specific patchwork property for which closure under weak composition implies the consistency of the input qcn experimentations with qcns of ia and rcc 8 show the importance and efficiency of this new approach

exchanging owl 2 ql knowledge bases  703
marcelo arenas elena botoeva diego calvanese vladislav ryzhikov

knowledge base exchange is an important problem in the area of data exchange and knowledge representation where one is interested in exchanging information between a source and a target knowledge base connected through a mapping in this paper we study this fundamental problem for knowledge bases and mappings expressed in owl 2 ql the profile of owl 2 based on the description logic dl liter more specifically we consider the problem of computing universal solutions identified as one of the most desirable translations to be materialized and the problem of computing ucq  representations which optimally capture in a target tbox the information that can be extracted from a source tbox and a mapping by means of unions of conjunctive queries for the former we provide a novel automata theoretic technique and complexity results that range from np to exptime while for the latter we show nlogspace completeness

temporal description logic for ontology based data access  711
alessandro artale roman kontchakov frank wolter michael zakharyaschev

our aim is to investigate ontology based data access over temporal data with validity time and ontologies capable of temporal conceptual modelling to this end we design a temporal description logic tql that extends the standard ontology language owl 2 ql provides basic means for temporal conceptual modelling and ensures first order rewritability of conjunctive queries for suitably defined data instances with validity time

functional stable model semantics and answer set programming modulo theories  718
michael bartholomew joohyung lee

recently there has been an increasing interest in incorporating "intensional" functions in answer set programming intensional functions are those whose values can be described by other functions and predicates rather than being pre defined as in the standard answer set programming we demonstrate that the functional stable model semantics plays an important role in the framework of "answer set programming modulo theories aspmt" — a tight integration of answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories under which existing integration approaches can be viewed as special cases where the role of functions is limited we show that "tight" aspmt programs can be translated into smt instances which is similar to the known relationship between asp and sat

decidability of model checking non uniform artifact centric quantified interpreted systems  725
francesco belardinelli alessio lomuscio

artifact centric systems are a novel paradigm in service oriented computing in the present contribution we show that model checking bounded non uniform artifact centric systems is undecidable we provide a partial model checking procedure for artifact centric systems against the universal fragment of a first order version of the logic ctl we obtain this result by introducing a counterpart semantics and developing an abstraction methodology operating on these structures this enables us to generate finite abstractions of infinite artifact centric systems hence perform verification on abstract models

reasoning about continuous uncertainty in the situation calculus  732
vaishak belle hector j levesque

among the many approaches for reasoning about degrees of belief in the presence of noisy sensing and acting the logical account proposed by bacchus halpern and levesque is perhaps the most expressive while their formalism is quite general it is restricted to fluents whose values are drawn from discrete countable domains as opposed to the continuous domains seen in many robotic applications in this paper we show how this limitation in their approach can be lifted by dealing seamlessly with both discrete distributions and continuous densities within a rich theory of action we provide a very general logical specification of how belief should change after acting and sensing in complex noisy domains

syntactic computation of hybrid possibilistic conditioning under uncertain inputs  739
salem benferhat célia da costa pereira andrea g b tettamanzi

we extend hybrid possibilistic conditioning to deal with inputs consisting of a set of triplets composed of propositional formulas the level at which the formulas should be accepted and the way in which their models should be revised we characterize such conditioning using elementary operations on possibility distributions we then solve a difficult issue that concerns the syntactic computation of the revision of possibilistic knowledge bases made of weighted formulas using hybrid conditioning an important result is that there is no extra computational cost in using hybrid possibilistic conditioning and in particular the size of the revised possibilistic base is polynomial with respect to the size of the initial base and the input

automating quantified conditional logics in hol  746
christoph benzmüller

a notion of quantified conditional logics is provided that includes quantification over individual and propositional variables the former is supported with respect to constant and variable domain semantics in addition a sound and complete embedding of this framework in classical higher order logic is presented using prominent examples from the literature it is demonstrated how this embedding enables effective automation of reasoning within object level and about meta level quantified conditional logics with off the shelf higher order theorem provers and model finders

first order rewritability of atomic queries in horn description logics  754
meghyn bienvenu carsten lutz frank wolter

one of the most advanced approaches to querying data in the presence of ontologies is to make use of relational database systems rewriting the original query and the ontology into a new query that is formulated in sql or equivalently in first order logic fo for ontologies written in many standard description logics dls however such fo rewritings are not guaranteed to exist we study fo rewritings and their existence for a basic class of queries and for ontologies formulated in horn dls such as horn shi and el our results include characterizations of the existence of fo rewritings tight complexity bounds for deciding whether an fo rewriting exists exptime and pspace and tight bounds on the worst case size of fo rewritings when presented as a union of conjunctive queries

conjunctive regular path queries in lightweight description logics  761
meghyn bienvenu magdalena ortiz mantas Šimkus

conjunctive regular path queries are an expressive extension of the well known class of conjunctive queries and have been extensively studied in the database community somewhat surprisingly there has been little work aimed at using such queries in the context of description logic dl knowledge bases and all existing results target expressive dls even though lightweight dls are considered better suited for data intensive applications this paper aims to bridge this gap by providing algorithms and tight complexity bounds for answering two way conjunctive regular path queries over dl knowledge bases formulated in lightweight dls of the dl lite and el families

tractable queries for lightweight description logics  768
meghyn bienvenu magdalena ortiz mantas Šimkus guohui xiao

it is a classic result in database theory that conjunctive query cq answering which is np complete in general is feasible in polynomial time when restricted to acyclic queries subsequent results identified more general structural properties of cqs like bounded treewidth which ensure tractable query evaluation in this paper we lift these tractability results to knowledge bases formulated in the lightweight description logics dl lite and elh the proof exploits known properties of query matches in these logics and involves a query dependent modification of the data to obtain a more practical approach we propose a concrete polynomial time algorithm for answering acyclic cqs based on rewriting queries into datalog programs a preliminary evaluation suggests the interest of our approach for handling large acyclic cqs

tractable approximations of consistent query answering for robust ontology based data access  775
meghyn bienvenu riccardo rosati

a robust system for ontology based data access should provide meaningful answers to queries even when the data conflicts with the ontology this can be accomplished by adopting an inconsistency tolerant semantics with the consistent query answering cqa semantics being the most prominent example unfortunately query answering under the cqa semantics has been shown to be computationally intractable even when extremely simple ontology languages are considered in this paper we address this problem by proposing two new families of inconsistency tolerant semantics which approximate the cqa semantics from above and from below and converge to it in the limit we study the data complexity of conjunctive query answering under these new semantics and show a general tractability result for all known first order rewritable ontology languages we also analyze the combined complexity of query answering for ontology languages of the dl lite family

the markov assumption formalization and impact  782
alexander bochman

we provide both a semantic interpretation and logical inferential characterization of the markov principle that underlies the main action theories in ai this principle will be shown to constitute a nonmonotonic assumption that justifies the actual restrictions on action descriptions in these theories as well as constraints on allowable queries it will be shown also that the well known regression principle is a consequence of the markov assumption and it is valid also for non deterministic domains

positive subsumption in fuzzy el with general t norms  789
stefan borgwardt rafael peñaloza

the description logic el is used to formulate several large biomedical ontologies fuzzy extensions of el can express the vagueness inherent in many biomedical concepts we study the reasoning problem of deciding positive subsumption in fuzzy el with semantics based on general t norms we show that the complexity of this problem depends on the specific t norm chosen more precisely if the t norm has zero divisors then the problem is co np hard otherwise it can be decided in polynomial time we also show that the best subsumption degree cannot be computed in polynomial time if the t norm contains the Łukasiewicz t norm

the impact of disjunction on query answering under guarded based existential rules  796
pierre bourhis michael morak andreas pieris

we study the complexity of conjunctive query answering under weakly frontier guarded disjunctive existential rules ie existential rules extended with disjunction and their main subclasses linear rules and inclusion dependencies ids our main result states that conjunctive query answering under a fixed set of disjunctive ids is 2exptime hard this quite surprising result together with a 2exptime upper bound for weakly frontier guarded disjunctive rules obtained by exploiting recent results on guarded negation first order logic gives us a complete picture of the computational complexity of our problem we also consider a natural subclass of disjunctive ids namely frontier one only one variable is propagated for which the combined complexity decreases to exptime finally we show that frontier guarded rules combined with negative constraints are strictly more expressive than dl litehbool one of the most expressive languages of the dl lite family we also show that query answering under this dl is 2exptime complete in combined complexity

abstract dialectical frameworks revisited  803
gerhard brewka stefan ellmauthaler hannes strass johannes peter wallner stefan woltran

we present various new concepts and results related to abstract dialectical frameworks adfs a powerful generalization of dungs argumentation frameworks afs in particular we show how the existing definitions of stable and preferred semantics which are restricted to the subcase of so called bipolar adfs can be improved and generalized to arbitrary frameworks furthermore we introduce preference handling methods for adfs allowing for both reasoning with and about preferences finally we present an implementation based on an encoding in answer set programming

verification of inconsistency aware knowledge and action bases  810
diego calvanese evgeny kharlamov marco montali ario santoso dmitriy zheleznyakov

description logic knowledge and action bases kabs have been recently introduced as a mechanism that provides a semantically rich representation of the information on the domain of interest in terms of a dl kb and a set of actions to change such information over time possibly introducing new objects in this setting decidability of verification of sophisticated temporal properties over kabs expressed in a variant of first order mu calculus has been shown however the established framework treats inconsistency in a simplistic way by rejecting inconsistent states produced through action execution we address this problem by showing how inconsistency handling based on the notion of repairs can be integrated into kabs resorting to inconsistency tolerant semantics in this setting we establish decidability and complexity of verification

automated reasoning to infer all minimal keys  817
p cordero m enciso a mora

wastl introduced for first time a tableaux like method based on an inference system for deriving all minimal keys from a relational schema he introduced two inference rules and built an automated method over themin this work we tackle the key finding problem with a tableaux method but we will use two inference rules inspired by the simplification logic for functional dependencies wastls method requires the input to be a set of functional dependencies with atomic right hand sides therefore it is necessary to apply fragmentation rule with the consequent increasing of the inputthe main novelty of our rules is that they deal with generalized formulas avoiding the fragmentation needed in the former tableaux finally we illustrate the advantages of our new tableaux method with an experiment

do hard sat related reasoning tasks become easier in the krom fragment  824
nadia creignou reinhard pichler stefan woltran

many ai related reasoning problems are based on the problem of satisfiability sat while sat itself becomes easy when restricting the structure of the formulas in a certain way this is not guaranteed for more involved reasoning problems in this work we focus on reasoning tasks in the areas of belief revision and logic based abduction and show that in some cases the restriction to krom formulas ie formulas in cnf where clauses have at most two literals decreases the complexity while in others it does not we thus also consider additional restrictions to krom formulas towards a better identification of the tractability frontier of such problems

computing datalog rewritings beyond horn ontologies  832
bernardo cuenca grau boris motik giorgos stoilos ian horrocks

rewriting based approaches for answering queries over an owl 2 dl ontology have so far been developed mainly for horn fragments of owl 2 dl in this paper we study the possibilities of answering queries over non horn ontologies using datalog rewritings we prove that this is impossible in general even for very simple ontology languages and even if ptime  np furthermore we present a resolution based procedure for shi ontologies that in case it terminates produces a datalog rewriting of the ontology we also show that our procedure necessarily terminates on dl liteboolh ontologies — an extension of owl 2 ql with transitive roles and boolean connectives

sequences of mechanisms for causal reasoning in artificial intelligence  839
denver dash mark voortman martijn de jongh

we present a new approach to token level causal reasoning that we call sequences of mechanisms soms which models causality as a dynamic sequence of active mechanisms that chain together to propagate causal influence through time we motivate this approach by using examples from ai and robotics and show why existing approaches are inadequate we present an algorithm for causal reasoning based on soms which takes as input a knowledge base of first order mechanisms and a set of observations and it hypothesizes which mechanisms are active at what time we show empirically that our algorithm produces plausible causal explanations of simulated observations generated from a causal model we argue that the soms approach is qualitatively closer to the human causal reasoning process for example it will only include relevant variables in explanations we present new insights about causal reasoning that become apparent with this view one such insight is that observation and manipulation do not commute in causal models a fact which we show to be a generalization of the equilibration manipulation commutability of dash2005

bounded epistemic situation calculus theories  846
giuseppe de giacomo yves lespérance fabio patrizi

we define the class of e bounded theories in the epistemic situation calculus where the number of fluent atoms that the agent thinks may be true is bounded by a constant such theories can still have an infinite domain and an infinite set of states we show that for them verification of an expressive class of first order mu calculus temporal epistemic properties is decidable we also show that if the agents knowledge in the initial situation is e bounded and the objective part of an action theory maintains boundedness then the entire epistemic theory is e bounded

linear temporal logic and linear dynamic logic on finite traces  854
giuseppe de giacomo moshe y vardi

in this paper we look into the assumption of interpreting ltl over finite traces in particular we show that ltlf ie ltl under this assumption is less expressive than what might appear at first sight and that at essentially no computational cost one can make a significant increase in expressiveness while maintaining the same intuitiveness of ltlf indeed we propose a logic ldlf for linear dynamic logic over finite traces which borrows the syntax from propositional dynamic logic pdl but is interpreted over finite traces satisfiability validity and logical implication as well as model checking for ldlf are pspace complete as for ltlf and ltl

a formal account of nondeterministic and failed actions  861
james p delgrande hector j levesque

nondeterminism is pervasive in all but the simplest action domains an agent may flip a coin or pick up a different object than intended or an action may fail and may fail in different ways in this paper we provide a qualitative theory of nondeterminism the account is based on an epistemic extension to the situation calculus that accommodates sensing actions our position is that nondeterminism is an epistemic phenomenon and that the world is most usefully regarded as deterministic nondeterminism arises from an agents limited awareness and perception the account offers several advantages an agent has a set of categorical as opposed to probabilistic beliefs yet can deal with equally likely outcomes such as in flipping a fair coin or with outcomes of differing plausibility such as an action that may on rare occasion fail

data repair of inconsistent dl programs  869
thomas eiter michael fink daria stepanova

nonmonotonic description logic dl programs support rule based reasoning on top of description logic ontologies using a well defined query interface however the interaction of the rules and the ontology may cause inconsistency such that no answer set ie model exists we thus consider repairing dl programs ie changing formulas to obtain consistency viewing the data part of the ontology as the source of inconsistency we define program repairs and repair answer sets based on changes to it we analyze the complexity of the notion and we extend an algorithm for evaluating dl programs to compute repair answer sets under optional selection of preferred repairs the extension involves a generalized ontology repair problem in which the entailment and non entailment of sets of queries with updates to the ontology must be achieved while this is intractable in general we identify for the description logic dl litea some tractable classes of preferred repairs that are useful in practice

towards a knowledge compilation map for heterogeneous representation languages  877
hélène fargier pierre marquis alexandre niveau

the knowledge compilation map introduced by darwiche and marquis takes advantage of a number of concepts mainly queries transformations expressiveness and succinctness to compare the relative adequacy of representation languages to some ai problems however the framework is limited to the comparison of languages that are interpreted in a homogeneous way formulae are interpreted as boolean functions this prevents one from comparing on a formal basis languages that are close in essence such as obdd mdd and add to fill the gap we present a generalized framework into which comparing formally heterogeneous representation languages becomes feasible in particular we explain how the key notions of queries and transformations expressiveness and succinctness can be lifted to the generalized setting

semiring labelled decision diagrams revisited canonicity and spatial efficiency issues  884
hélène fargier pierre marquis nicolas schmidt

existing languages in the valued decision diagrams vdds family including add aadd and those of the sldd family prove to be valuable target languages for compiling multivariate functions however their efficiency is directly related to the size of the compiled formulaein practice the existence of canonical forms may have a major impact on the size of the compiled vdds while efficient normalization procedures have been pointed out for add and aadd the canonicity issue for sldd formulae has not been addressed so far in this paper the sldd family is revisited we modify the algebraic requirements imposed on the valuation structure so as to ensure tractable conditioning optimization and normalization for some languages of the revisited sldd family we show that aadd is captured by this family finally we compare the spatial efficiency of some languages of this family from both the theoretical side and the practical side

fqht the logic of stable models for logic programs with intensional functions  891
luis fariñas del cerro david pearce agustín valverde

we study a logical system fqht that is appropriate for reasoning about nonmonotonic theories with intensional functions as treated in the approach of bartholomew and lee 2012 we provide a logical semantics a gentzen style proof theory and establish completeness results the adequacy of the approach is demonstrated by showing that it captures the bartholemewlee semantics and satisfies a strong equivalence property

on the complexity of probabilistic abstract argumentation  898
bettina fazzinga sergio flesca francesco parisi

probabilistic abstract argumentation combines dungs abstract argumentation framework with probability theory in order to model uncertainty in argumentation in this setting we address the fundamental problem of computing the probability that a set of arguments is an extension according to a given semantics we focus on the most popular semantics ie admissible stable complete grounded preferred ideal and show the following dichotomy result computing the probability that a set of arguments is an extension is either ptime or fpp complete depending on the semantics adopted our ptime results are particularly interesting as they hold for some semantics for which no polynomial time technique was known so far

representation and reasoning about general solid rectangles  905
xiaoyu ge jochen renz

entities in two dimensional space are often approximated using rectangles that are parallel to the two axes that define the space so called minimum bounding rectangles mbrs mbrs are popular in computer vision and other areas as they are easy to obtain and easy to represent in the area of qualitative spatial reasoning many different spatial representations are based on mbrs surprisingly there has been no such representation proposed for general rectangles ie rectangles that can have any angle nor for general solid rectangles gsrs that cannot penetrate each other gsrs are often used in computer graphics and computer games such as angry birds where they form the building blocks of more complicated structures in order to represent and reason about these structures we need a spatial representation that allows us to use gsrs as the basic spatial entities in this paper we develop and analyze a qualitative spatial representation for gsrs we apply our representation and the corresponding reasoning methods to solve a very interesting practical problem assuming we want to detect gsrs in computer games but computer vision can only detect mbrs how can we infer the gsrs from the given mbrs we evaluate our solution and test its usefulness in a real gaming scenario

advanced conflict driven disjunctive answer set solving  912
martin gebser benjamin kaufmann torsten schaub

we introduce a new approach to disjunctive asp solving that aims at an equitable interplay between "generating" and "testing" solver units to this end we develop novel characterizations of answer sets and unfounded sets allowing for a bidirectional dynamic information exchange between solver units for orthogonal tasks this results in the new multi threaded disjunctive asp solver claspd 2 greatly improving the performance of existing systems

a strongly local contextual logic  919
michael james gratton

a novel contextual logic is presented that combines features of both multi context systems and logics of context broadly contextual logics are those with a formal notion of context — knowledge that is true only under specific assumptions multi context systems use discrete logistic systems as individual contexts related by meta level rules whereas logics of context partition a single knowledge base into contexts related using object level rules the contextual logic presented here is strongly local in that knowledge and inference is discrete for individual contexts but which are nevertheless part of a single logistic system that relates contexts at the object level so combining advantages of both a deductive system of contextual inference and a possible worlds based semantics is given with formal results including soundness and completeness and a number of properties are examined

bounded programs a new decidable class of logic programs with function symbols  926
sergio greco cristian molinaro irina trubitsyna

while function symbols are widely acknowledged as an important feature in logic programming they make common inference tasks undecidable to cope with this problem recent research has focused on identifying classes of logic programs imposing restrictions on the use of function symbols but guaranteeing decidability of common inference tasks this has led to several criteria called termination criteria providing sufficient conditions for a program to have finitely many stable models each of finite sizethis paper introduces the new class of bounded programs which guarantees the aforementioned property and strictly includes the classes of programs determined by current termination criteria different results on the correctness the expressiveness and the complexity of the class of bounded programs are presented

iterated boolean games  932
julian gutierrez paul harrenstein michael wooldridge

iterated games are well known in the game theory literature we study iterated boolean games these are games in which players repeatedly choose truth values for boolean variables they have control over our model of iterated boolean games assumes that players have goals given by formulae of linear temporal logic ltl a formalism for expressing properties of state sequences in order to model the strategies that players use in such games we use a finite state machine model after introducing and formally defining iterated boolean games we investigate the computational complexity of their associated game theoretic decision problems as well as semantic conditions characterising classes of ltl properties that are preserved by pure strategy nash equilibria whenever they exist

implicit learning of common sense for reasoning  939
brendan juba

we consider the problem of how enormous databases of "common sense" knowledge can be both learned and utilized in reasoning in a computationally efficient manner we propose that this is possible if the learning only occurs implicitly ie without generating an explicit representation we show that it is feasible to invoke such implicitly learned knowledge in essentially all natural tractable reasoning problems this implicit learning also turns out to be provably robust to occasional counterexamples as appropriate for such common sense knowledge

knowledge compilation for model counting affine decision trees  947
frédéric koriche jean marie lagniez pierre marquis samuel thomas

counting the models of a propositional formula is a key issue for a number of ai problems but few propositional languages offer the possibility to count models efficiently in order to fill the gap we introduce the language eadt of extended affine decision trees an extended affine decision tree simply is a tree with affine decision nodes and some specific decomposable conjunction or disjunction nodes unlike standard decision trees the decision nodes of an eadt formula are not labeled by variables but by affine clauses we study eadt and several subsets of it along the lines of the knowledge compilation map we also describe a cnf to eadt compiler and present some experimental results those results show that the eadt compilation based approach is competitive with and in some cases is able to outperform the model counter cachet and the d dnnf compilation based approach to model counting

parameterized complexity of optimal planning a detailed map  954
martin kronegger andreas pfandler reinhard pichler

the goal of this paper is a systematic parameterized complexity analysis of different variants of propositional strips planning we identify several natural problem parameters and study all possible combinations of 9 parameters in 6 different settings these settings arise for instance from the distinction if negative effects of actions are allowed or not we provide a complete picture by establishing for each case either paranp hardness ie the parameter combination does not help or wt completeness with t ∈ 12 ie fixed parameter intractability or fpt ie fixed parameter tractability

syntactic labelled tableaux for Łukasiewicz fuzzy alc  962
agnieszka kułacka dirk pattinson lutz schröder

fuzzy description logics dls serve as a tool to handle vagueness in real world knowledge there is particular interest in logics implementing lukasiewicz semantics which has a number of favourable properties current decision procedures for lukasiewicz fuzzy dls work by reduction to exponentially large mixed integer programming problems here we present a decision method that stays closer to logical syntax a labelled tableau algorithm for lukasiewicz fuzzy alc that calls only on pure linear programming and this only to decide atomic clashes the algorithm realizes the best known complexity bound nexptime our language features a novel style of fuzzy aboxes that work with comparisons of truth degrees rather than explicit numerical bounds

decidable reasoning in a logic of limited belief with introspection and unknown individuals  969
gerhard lakemeyer hector j levesque

there are not very many existing logics of belief which have both a perspicuous semantics and are computationally attractive an exception is the logic sl proposed by liu lakemeyer and levesque which allows for a decidable and often even tractable form of reasoning while the language is first order and hence quite expressive it still has a number of shortcomings for one beliefs about beliefs are not addressed at all for another the names of individuals are rigid that is their identity is assumed to be known in this paper we show how both shortcomings can be overcome by suitably extending the language and its semantics among other things we show that determining the beliefs of a certain kind of fully introspective knowledge bases is decidable and that unknown individuals in the knowledge base can be accommodated in a decidable manner as well

starvars—effective reasoning about relative directions  976
jae hee lee jochen renz diedrich wolter

relative direction information is very commonly used observers typically describe their environment by specifying the relative directions in which they see other objects or other people from their point of view or they receive navigation instructions with respect to their point of view for example turn left at the next intersection however it is surprisingly hard to integrate relative direction information obtained from different observers and to reconstruct a model of the environment or the locations of the observers based on this information despite intensive research there is currently no algorithm that can effectively integrate this information this problem is np hard but not known to be in np even if we only use left and right relations in this paper we present a novel qualitative representation starvars that can solve these problems it is an extension of the star calculus renz and mitra 2004 by a variable interpretation of the orientation of observers we show that reasoning in starvars is in np and present the first algorithm that allows us to effectively integrate relative direction information from different observers

the action description languages b and c have significant common core nevertheless some expressive possibilities of b are difficult or impossible to simulate in c and the other way around the main advantage of b is that it allows the user to give prolog style recursive definitions which is important in applications on the other hand b solves the frame problem by incorporating the commonsense law of inertia in its semantics which makes it difficult to talk about fluents whose behavior is described by defaults other than inertia in c and in its extension c the inertia assumption is expressed by axioms that the user is free to include or not to include and other defaults can be postulated as well this paper defines a new action description language called bc that combines the attractive features of b and c examples of formalizing commonsense domains discussed in the paper illustrate the expressive capabilities of bc and the use of answer set solvers for the automation of reasoning about actions described in this language

answer set programming modulo theories and reasoning about continuous changes  990
joohyung lee yunsong meng

answer set programming modulo theories aspmt is a new framework of tight integration of answer set programming asp and satisfiability modulo theories smt similar to the relationship between first order logic and smt it is based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing interpretations of background theories analogously to a known relationship between asp and sat "tight" aspmt programs can be translated into smt instances we demonstrate the usefulness of aspmt by enhancing action language c to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes we reformulate the semantics of c in terms of aspmt and show that smt solvers can be used to compute the language we also show how the language can represent cumulative effects on continuous resources

reasoning about state constraints in the situation calculus  997
naiqi li yi fan yongmei liu

in dynamic systems state constraints are formulas that hold in every reachable state it has been shown that state constraints can be used to greatly reduce the planning search space they are also useful in program verification in this paper we propose a sound but incomplete method for automatic verification and discovery of state constraints for a class of action theories that include many planning benchmarks our method is formulated in the situation calculus theoretically based on skolemization and herbrand theorem and implemented with sat solvers basically we verify a state constraint by strengthening it in a novel and smart way so that it becomes a state invariant we experimented with the blocks world logistics and satellite domains and the results showed that almost all known state constraints can be verified in a reasonable amount of time and meanwhile succinct and intuitive related state constraints are discovered

analogico deductive generation of gödels first incompleteness theorem from the liar paradox  1004
john licato naveen sundar govindarajulu selmer bringsjord michael pomeranz logan gittelson

gödels proof of his famous first incompleteness theorem g1 has quite understandably long been a tantalizing target for those wanting to engineer impressively intelligent computational systems after all in establishing g1 gödel did something that by any metric must be classified as stunningly intelligent we observe that it has long been understood that there is some sort of analogical relationship between the liar paradox lp and g1 and that gödel himself appreciated and exploited the relationship yet the exact nature of the relationship has hitherto not been uncovered by which we mean that the following question has not been answered given a description of lpand the suspicion that it may somehow be used by a suitably programmed computing machine to find a proof of the incompleteness of peano arithmetic can such a machine provided this description as input produce as output a complete and verifiably correct proof of g1 in this paper we summarize engineering that entails an affirmative answer to this question our approach uses what we call analogico deductive reasoning adr which combines analogical and deductive reasoning to produce a full deductive proof of g1 from lp our engineering uses a form of adr based on our meta r system and a connection between the liar sentence in lp and gödels fixed point lemma from which g1 follows quickly

an epistemic halpern–shoham logic  1010
alessio r lomuscio jakub michaliszyn

we define a family of epistemic extensions of halpern shoham logic for reasoning about temporal epistemic properties of multi agent systems we exemplify their use and study the complexity of their model checking problem we show a range of results ranging from ptime to pspace hard depending on the logic considered

preference based query answering in datalog– ontologies  1017
thomas lukasiewicz maria vanina martinez gerardo i simari

the study of preferences has a long tradition in many disciplines but it has only relatively recently entered the realm of data management through their application in answering queries to relational databases the current revolution in data availability through the web and perhaps most importantly in the last few years social media sites and applications puts ontology languages at the forefront of data and information management technologies in this paper we propose the first to our knowledge integration of ontology languages with preferences as in relational databases by developing prefdatalog  an extension of the datalog  family of languages with preference management formalisms closely related to those previously studied for relational databases we focus on two kinds of answers to queries that are relevant to this setting skyline and k rank a generalization of top k queries and develop algorithms for computing these answers to both daqs disjunctions of atomic queries and cqs conjunctive queries we show that daq answering in prefdatalog  can be done in polynomial time in the data complexity as in relational databases as long as query answering can also be done in polynomial time in the data complexity in the underlying classical ontology

ontology based data access with closed predicates is inherently intractable sometimes  1024
carsten lutz inanç seylan frank wolter

when answering queries in the presence of ontologies adopting the closed world assumption for some predicates easily results in intractability we analyze this situation on the level of individual ontologies formulated in the description logics dl lite and el and show that in all cases where answering cqs with open and closed predicates is tractable it coincides with answering cqs with all predicates assumed open in this sense cq answering with closed predicates in inherently intractable our analysis also yields a dichotomy between ac0 and conp for cq answering in dl lite and a dichotomy between ptime and conp for el interestingly the situation is less dramatic in the more expressive description logic eli where we find ontologies for which cq answering is in ptime but does not coincide with cq answering where all predicates are open

computing stable models for nonmonotonic existential rules  1031
despoina magka markus krötzsch ian horrocks

in this work we consider function free existential rules extended with nonmonotonic negation under a stable model semantics we present new acyclicity and stratification conditions that identify a large class of rule sets having finite unique stable models and we show how the addition of constraints on the input facts can further extend this class checking these conditions is computationally feasible and we provide tight complexity bounds finally we demonstrate how these new methods allowed us to solve relevant reasoning problems over a real world knowledge base from biochemistry using an off the shelf answer set programming engine

the route to success – a performance comparison of diagnosis algorithms  1039
iulia nica ingo pill thomas quaritsch franz wotawa

diagnosis ie the identification of root causes for failing or unexpected system behavior is an important task in practice within the last three decades many different ai based solutions for solving the diagnosis problem have been presented and have been gaining in attraction this leaves us with the question of which algorithm to prefer in a certain situation in this paper we contribute to answering this question in particular we compare two classes of diagnosis algorithms one class exploits conflicts in their search ie sets of system components whose correct behavior contradicts given observations the other class ignores conflicts and derives diagnoses from observations and the underlying model directly in our study we use different reasoning engines ranging from an optimized horn clause theorem prover to general sat and constraint solvers thus we also address the question whether publicly available general reasoning engines can be used for an efficient diagnosis

backdoors to abduction  1046
andreas pfandler stefan rümmele stefan szeider

abductive reasoning or abduction for short is among the most fundamental ai reasoning methods with a broad range of applications including fault diagnosis belief revision and automated planning unfortunately abduction is of high computational complexity even propositional abduction is Σ2p complete and thus harder than np and conp this complexity barrier rules out the existence of a polynomial transformation to propositional satisfiability sat in this work we use structural properties of the abduction instance to break this complexity barrier we utilize the problem structure in terms of small backdoor sets we present fixed parameter tractable transformations from abduction to sat which make the power of todays sat solvers available to abduction

behavioral diagnosis of ltl specifications at operator level  1053
ingo pill thomas quaritsch

product defects and rework efforts due to flawed specifications represent major issues for a projects performance so that there is a high motivation for providing effective means that assist designers in assessing and ensuring a specifications quality recent research in the context of formal specifications eg on coverage and vacuity offers important means to tackle related issues in the currently underrepresented research direction of diagnostic reasoning on a specification we propose a scenario based diagnosis at a specifications operator level using weak or strong fault models drawing on efficient sat encodings we show in this paper how to achieve that effectively for specifications in ltl our experimental results illustrate our approachs validity and attractiveness

cyclic causal models with discrete variables markov chain equilibrium semantics and sample ordering  1060
david poole mark crowley

we analyze the foundations of cyclic causal models for discrete variables and compare structural equation models sems to an alternative semantics as the equilibrium stationary distribution of a markov chain we show under general conditions discrete cyclic sems cannot have independent noise even in the simplest case cyclic structural equation models imply constraints on the noise we give a formalization of an alternative markov chain equilibrium semantics which requires not only the causal graph but also a sample order we show how the resulting equilibrium is a function of the sample ordering both theoretically and empirically

learning from polyhedral sets  1069
salvatore ruggieri

parameterized linear systems allow for modelling and reasoning over classes of polyhedra collections of squares rectangles polytopes and so on can readily be defined by means of linear systems with parameters in this paper we investigate the problem of learning a parameterized linear system whose class of polyhedra includes a given set of example polyhedral sets and it is minimal

efficient extraction and representation of spatial information from video data  1076
hajar sadeghi sokeh stephen gould jochen renz

vast amounts of video data are available on the web and are being generated daily using surveillance cameras or other sources being able to efficiently analyse and process this data is essential for a number of different applications we want to be able to efficiently detect activities in these videos or be able to extract and store essential information contained in these videos for future use and easy search and access cohn et al 2012 proposed a comprehensive representation of spatial features that can be efficiently extracted from video and used for these purposes in this paper we present a modified version of this approach that is equally efficient and allows us to extract spatial information with much higher accuracy than previously possible we present efficient algorithms both for extracting and storing spatial information from video as well as for processing this information in order to obtain useful spatial features we evaluate our approach and demonstrate that the extracted spatial information is considerably more accurate than that obtained from existing approaches

combining rcc5 relations with betweenness information  1083
steven schockaert sanjiang li

rcc5 is an important and well known calculus for representing and reasoning about mereological relations among many other applications it is pivotal in the formalization of commonsense reasoning about natural categories in particular it allows for a qualitative representation of conceptual spaces in the sense of gardenfors to further the role of rcc5 as a vehicle for conceptual reasoning in this paper we combine rcc5 relations with information about betweenness of regions the resulting calculus allows us to express for instance that some part but not all of region b is between regions a and c we show how consistency can be decided in polynomial time for atomic networks even when regions are required to be convex from an application perspective the ability to express betweenness information allows us to use rcc5 as a basis for interpolative reasoning while the restriction to convex regions ensures that all consistent networks can be faithfully represented as a conceptual space

interpolative reasoning with default rules  1090
steven schockaert henri prade

default reasoning and interpolation are two important forms of commonsense rule based reasoning the former allows us to draw conclusions from incompletely specified states by making assumptions on normality whereas the latter allows us to draw conclusions from states that are not explicitly covered by any of the available rules although both approaches have received considerable attention in the literature it is at present not well understood how they can be combined to draw reasonable conclusions from incompletely specified states and incomplete rule bases in this paper we introduce an inference system for interpolating default rules based on a geometric semantics in which normality is related to spatial density and interpolation is related to geometric betweenness we view default rules and information on the betweenness of natural categories as particular types of constraints on qualitative representations of gärdenfors conceptual spaces we propose an axiomatization extending the well known system p and show its soundness and completeness wrt the proposed semantics subsequently we explore how our extension of preferential reasoning can be further refined by adapting two classical approaches for handling the irrelevance problem in default reasoning rational closure and conditional entailment

on condensing a sequence of updates in answer set programming  1097
martin slota joão leite

update semantics for answer set programming assign models to sequences of answer set programs which result from the iterative process of updating programs by programs each program in the sequence represents an update of the preceding ones one of the enduring problems in this context is state condensing or the problem of determining a single logic program that faithfully represents the sequence of programs such logic program should 1 be written in the same alphabet 2 have the same stable models and 3 be equivalent to the sequence of programs when subject to further updates it has been known for more than a decade that update semantics easily lead to non minimal stable models so an update sequence cannot be represented by a single non disjunctive program on the other hand more expressive classes of programs were never considered mainly because it was not clear how they could be updated further in this paper we solve the state condensing problem for two foundational rule update semantics using nested logic programs furthermore we also show that disjunctive programs with default negation in the head can be used for the same purpose

nominal schema absorption  1104
andreas steigmiller birte glimm thorsten liebig

nominal schemas have recently been introduced as a new approach for the integration of dl safe rules into the description logic framework the efficient processing of knowledge bases with nominal schemas remains however challenging we address this by extending the well known optimisation of absorption as well as the standard tableau calculus to directly handle the absorbed nominal schema axioms we implement the resulting extension of standard tableau calculi in a novel reasoning system and we integrate further optimisations in our empirical evaluation we show the effect of these optimisations and we find that the proposed approach performs well even when compared to other dl reasoners with dedicated rule support

granular description of qualitative change  1111
john g stell

qualitative representations of spatial knowledge have been widely studied and a variety of frameworks are used to express relationships between static regions dynamic regions present a much greater challenge but are important in practical applications such as describing crowds of people moving over time previous work has analysed changes as regions merge and split and as new regions are created and existing ones disappear we present a novel framework for the qualitative description of spatial regions based on two levels of granularity introducing granularity yields significantly more informative qualitative descriptions than are available from a single level of detail the formal model represents a region which may have multiple components as a bipartite graph where the nodes are the components of the region at a fine level of detail and at a coarse level the edges of the graph model the way that a component in the coarse view can be made up of parts of components at the more detailed level we show that all graphs of this form except for some degenerate cases can be realized as regions in a discrete space of pixels and we develop a theory of relations between these graphs to model the dynamic behaviour of regions

a rational extension of stable model semantics to the full propositional language  1118
shahab tasharrofi

answer set programming is the most appreciated framework for non monotonic reasoning stable model semantics as the semantics behind this success has been subject to many extensions the two main such extensions are equilibrium models and flp semantics despite their very interesting foundations they both have two problems they cannot guarantee either minimality or rationality of their intended models that is both these semantics allow models in which some atoms are self justified ie the only possible reason for including those atoms in the model are those atoms themselves present paper extends stable model semantics to the full propositional language while guaranteeing both properties above our extension is called supported because it guarantees the existence of non circular justifications for all atoms in a supported model these goals are achieved through a form of completion in intuitionistic logic we also discuss how supported models relate to other semantics for non monotonic reasoning such as equilibrium models finally we discuss the complexity of reasoning about supported models and show that the complexity of bravecautious reasoning in supported semantics remains as before ie the rationality property comes for no additional cost

compact rewritings for existential rules  1125
michaël thomazo

querying large databases while taking ontologies into account is currently a very active domain research in this paper we consider ontologies described by existential rules also known as datalog  a framework that generalizes lightweight description logics a common approach is to rewrite a conjunctive query wrt an ontology into a union of conjunctive queries ucq which can be directly evaluated against a database however the practicability of this approach is questionable due to 1 the weak expressivity of classes for which efficient rewriters have been implemented 2 the large size of optimal rewritings using ucq we propose to use semi conjunctive queries scq which are a restricted form of positive existential formulas and compute sound and complete rewritings which are union of scq uscq a novel algorithm for query rewriting compact is presented it computes sound and complete rewritings for large classes of ontologies first experiments show that uscq are both efficiently computable and more efficiently evaluable than their equivalent ucq

a classification of first order progressable action theories in situation calculus  1132
stavros vassos fabio patrizi

projection in the situation calculus refers to answering queries about the future evolutions of the modeled domain while progression refers to updating the logical representation of the initial state so that it reflects the changes due to an executed action in the general case projection is not decidable and progression may require second order logic in this paper we focus on a recent result about the decidability of projection and use it to drive results for the problem of progression in particular we contribute with the following i a major result showing that for a large class of intuitive action theories with bounded unknowns a first order progression always exists and can be computed ii a comprehensive classification of the known classes that can be progressed in first order iii a novel account of nondeterministic actions in the situation calculus

an alternative axiomatization of del and its applications  1139
yanjing wang guillaume aucher

in this paper we provide a new axiomatization of the event model based dynamic epistemic logic based on the completeness proof method proposed in wang and cao 2013 this axiomatization does not use any of the standard reduction axioms but naturally captures the essence of the update product we demonstrate the use of our new axiomatization and the corresponding proof techniques by three sets of results characterization theorems of the update operations representation theorems of the del generatable epistemic temporal structures given a fixed event model and a complete axiomatization of del on models with protocols

knowing that knowing what and public communication public announcement logic with kv operators  1147
yanjing wang jie fan

in his seminal work plaza 1989 plaza proposed the public announcement logic pal which is considered as the pilot logic in the field of dynamic epistemic logic in the same paper plaza also introduced an interesting "know value" operator kv and listed a few valid formulas of palkv however it is unknown that whether these formulas on top of the axioms for pal completely axiomatize palkv in this paper we first give a negative answer to this open problem moreover we generalize the kv operator and show that in the setting of pal replacing the kv operator with its generalized version does not increase the expressive power of the resulting logic this suggests that we can simply use the more flexible generalization instead of the original palkv as the main result we give a complete proof system for pal plus the generalized operator based on a complete axiomatization of epistemic logic with the same operator in the single agent setting

multi agent subset space logic  1155
yì n wáng thomas Ågotnes

subset space logics have been introduced and studied as a framework for reasoning about a notion of effort in epistemic logic the seminal subset space logic ssl by moss and parikh modeled a single agent and most work in this area has focused on different extensions of the language or different model classes resulting from restrictions on subset spaces while still keeping the single agent assumption in this paper we argue that the few existing attempts at multi agent versions of ssl are unsatisfactory and propose a new multi agent subset space logic which is a natural extension of single agent ssl the main results are a sound and complete axiomatization of this logic as well as an alternative and equivalent relational semantics

forgetting for answer set programs revisited  1162
yisong wang kewen wang mingyi zhang

a new semantic forgetting for answer set programs asp called sm forgetting is proposed in the paperit distinguishes itself from the others in that it preserves not only skeptical and credulous consequences on unforgotten variables but also strong equivalence — forgetting same variables in strongly equivalent logic programs has strongly equivalent results the forgetting presents a positive answer to gabbay pearce and valverdes open question — if asp has uniform interpolation property we also investigate some properties algorithm and computational complexities for the forgetting it shows that computing the forgetting result is generally intractable even for horn logic programs

transition constraints a study on the computational complexity of qualitative change  1169
matthias westphal julien hué stefan wölfl bernhard nebel

many formalisms discussed in the literature on qualitative spatial reasoning are designed for expressing static spatial constraints only however dynamic situations arise in virtually all applications of these formalisms which makes it necessary to study variants and extensions involving change this paper presents a study on the computational complexity of qualitative change more precisely we discuss the reasoning task of finding a solution to a temporal sequence of static reasoning problems where this sequence is subject to additional transition constraints our focus is primarily on smoothness and continuity constraints we show how such transitions can be defined as relations and expressed within qualitative constraint formalisms our results demonstrate that for point based constraint formalisms the interesting fragments become np complete in the presence of continuity constraints even if the satisfiability problem of its static descriptions is tractable

supremal realizability of behaviors with uncontrollable exogenous events  1176
nitin yadav paolo felli giuseppe de giacomo sebastian sardina

the behavior composition problem involves the automatic synthesis of a controller able to "realize" ie implement a desired target behavior specification by suitably coordinating a set of already available behaviors while the problem has been thoroughly studied one open issue has resisted a principled solution if the target specification is not fully realizable is there a way to realize it "at best" in this paper we answer positively by showing that there exists a unique supremal realizable target behavior satisfying the specification more importantly we give an effective procedure to compute such a target then we introduce exogenous events and show that the supremal can again be computed though this time into two variants depending on the ability to observe such events

multi agent epistemic explanatory diagnosis via reasoning about actions  1183
quan yu ximing wen yongmei liu

the task of explanatory diagnosis conjectures actions to explain observationsthis is a common task in real life and an essential ability of intelligent agentsit becomes more complicated in multi agent scenarios since agents actions may be partially observable to other agents and observations might involve agents knowledge about the world or other agents knowledge or even common knowledge of a group of agentsfor example we might want to explain the observation that p does not holdbut ann believes p or the observation that ann bob and carl commonly believe p in this paper we formalize the multi agent explanatory diagnosis task in the framework of dynamic epistemic logic where kripke models of actions are used to represent agents partial observability of actions since this task is undecidable in general we identify important decidable fragments via techniques of reducing the potentially infinite search spaces to finite ones of epistemic states or action sequences

most specific generalizations wrt general el tboxes  1191
benjamin zarrieß anni yasmin turhan

in the area of description logics the least common subsumer lcs and the most specific concept msc are inferences that generalize a set of concepts or an individual respectively into a single concept if computed wrt a general el tbox neither the lcs nor the msc need to exist so far in this setting no exact conditions for the existence of lcs  or msc concepts are known this paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these two kinds of concepts for the lcs of a fixed number of concepts and the msc we show decidability of the existence in ptime and polynomial bounds on the maximal role depth of the lcs  and msc concepts this bound allows to compute the lcs and the msc respectively

first order expressibility and boundedness of disjunctive logic programs  1198
heng zhang yan zhang

in this paper the fixed point semantics developed in lobo et al 1992 is generalized to disjunctive logic programs with default negation and over arbitrary structures and proved to coincide with the stable model semantics by using the tool of ultraproducts a preservation theorem which asserts that a disjunctive logic program without default negation is bounded with respect to the proposed semantics if and only if it has a first order equivalent is then obtained for the disjunctive logic programs with default negation a sufficient condition assuring the first order expressibility is also proposed

definability of horn revision from horn contraction  1205
zhiqiang zhuang maurice pagnucco yan zhang

in the agm framework alchourron and makinson 1985 a revision function can be defined directly through constructions like systems of spheres epistemic entrenchment etc or indirectly through a contraction operation via the levi identity a recent trend is to construct agm style contraction and revision functions that operate under horn logic a direct construction of horn revision is given in delgrande and peppas 2011 however it is unknown whether horn revision can be defined indirectly from horn contraction in this paper we address this problem by obtaining a model based horn revision through the model based horn contraction studied in zhuang and pagnucco 2012 our result shows that under proper restrictions horn revision is definable through horn contraction via the levi identity

learning community based preferences via dirichlet process mixtures of gaussian processes  1213
ehsan abbasnejad scott sanner edwin v bonilla pascal poupart

bayesian approaches to preference learning using gaussian processesgps are attractive due to their ability to explicitly model uncertainty in users latent utility functions unfortunately existing techniques have cubic time complexity in the number of users which renders this approach intractable for collaborative preference learning over a large user base exploiting the observation that user populations often decompose into communities of shared preferences we model user preferences as an infinite dirichlet process dp mixture of communities and learn a the expected number of preference communities represented in the data b a gp based preference model over items tailored to each community and c the mixture weights representing each users fraction of community membership this results in a learning and inference process that scales linearly in the number of users rather than cubicly and additionally provides the ability to analyze individual community preferences and their associated members we evaluate our approach on a variety of preference data sources including amazon mechanical turk showing that our method is more scalable and as accurate as previous gp based preference learning work

an ensemble of bayesian networks for multilabel classification  1220
antonucci alessandro giorgio corani denis mauá sandra gabaglio

we present a novel approach for multilabel classification based on an ensemble of bayesian networks the class variables are connected by a tree each model of the ensemble uses a different class as root of the tree we assume the features to be conditionally independent given the classes thus generalizing the naive bayes assumption to the multiclass case this assumption allows us to optimally identify the correlations between classes and features such correlations are moreover shared across all models of the ensemble inferences are drawn from the ensemble via logarithmic opinion pooling to minimize hamming loss we compute the marginal probability of the classes by running standard inference on each bayesian network in the ensemble and then pooling the inferences to instead minimize the subset 01 loss we pool the joint distributions of each model and cast the problem as a map inference in the corresponding graphical model experiments show that the approach is competitive with state of the art methods for multilabel classification

self organized neural learning of statistical inference from high dimensional data  1226
johannes bauer stefan wermter

with information about the world implicitly embedded in complex high dimensional neural population responses the brain must perform some sort of statistical inference on a large scale to form hypotheses about the state of the environment this ability is in part acquired after birth and often with very little feedback to guide learning this is a very difficult learning problem considering the little information about the meaning of neural responses available at birth in this paper we address the question of how the brain might solve this problem we present an unsupervised artificial neural network algorithm which takes from the self organizing map som algorithm the ability to learn a latent variable model from its input we extend the som algorithm so it learns about the distribution of noise in the input and computes probability density functions over the latent variables the algorithm represents these probability density functions using population codes this is done with very few assumptions about the distribution of noise our simulations indicate that our algorithm can learn to perform similar to a maximum likelihood estimator with the added benefit of requiring no a priori knowledge about the input and computing not only best hypotheses but also probabilities for alternatives

basic level in formal concept analysis interesting concepts and psychological ramifications  1233
radim belohlavek martin trnecka

we present a study regarding basic level of concepts in conceptual categorization the basic level of concepts is an important phenomenon studied in the psychology of concepts we propose to utilize this phenomenon in formal concept analysis to select important formal concepts such selection is critical because as is well known the number of all concepts extracted from data is usually large we review and formalize the main existing psychological approaches to basic level which are presented only informally and are not related to any particular formal model of concepts in the psychological literature we argue and demonstrate by examples that basic level concepts may be regarded as interesting informative formal concepts from a user viewpoint interestingly our formalization and experiments reveal previously unknown relationships between the existing approaches to basic level thuswe argue that a formalization of basic level in the framework of formal concept analysis is beneficial for the psychological investigations themselves because it helps put them on a solid formal ground

exact top k feature selection via l20 norm constraint  1240
xiao cai feiping nie heng huang

in this paper we propose a novel robust and pragmatic feature selection approach unlike those sparse learning based feature selection methods which tackle the approximate problem by imposing sparsity regularization in the objective function the proposed method only has one l21 norm loss term with an explicit l20 norm equality constraint an efficient algorithm based on augmented lagrangian method will be derived to solve the above constrained optimization problem to find out the stable local solution extensive experiments on four biological datasets show that although our proposed model is not a convex problem it outperforms the approximate convex counterparts and state of the art feature selection methods evaluated in terms of classification accuracy by two popular classifiers what is more since the regularization parameter of our method has the explicit meaning ie the number of feature selected it avoids the burden of tuning the parameter making it a pragmatic feature selection method

regularized latent least square regression for cross pose face recognition  1247
xinyuan cai chunheng wang baihua xiao xue chen ji zhou

pose variation is one of the challenging factors for face recognition in this paper we propose a novel cross pose face recognition method named as regularized latent least square regression rllsr the basic assumption is that the images captured under different poses of one person can be viewed as pose specific transforms of a single ideal object we treat the observed images as regressor the ideal object as response and then formulate this assumption in the least square regression framework so as to learn the multiple pose specific transforms specifically we incorporate some prior knowledge as two regularization terms into the least square approach 1 the smoothness regularization as the transforms for nearby poses should not differ too much 2 the local consistency constraint as the distribution of the latent ideal objects should preserve the geometric structure of the observed image space we develop an alternating algorithm to simultaneously solve for the ideal objects of the training individuals and a set of pose specific transforms the experimental results on the multi pie dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and superiority over the previous methods

robust tensor clustering with non greedy maximization  1254
xiaochun cao xingxing wei yahong han yi yang dongdai lin

tensors are increasingly common in several areas such as data mining computer graphics and computer vision tensor clustering is a fundamental tool for data analysis and pattern discovery however there usually exist outlying data points in real world datasets which will reduce the performance of clustering this motivates us to develop a tensor clustering algorithm that is robust to the outliers in this paper we propose an algorithm of robust tensor clustering rtc the rtc firstly finds a lower rank approximation of the original tensor data using a l1 norm optimization function because the l1 norm doesnt exaggerate the effect of outliers compared with l2 norm the minimization of the l1 norm approximation function makes rtc robust to outliers then we compute the hosvd decomposition of this approximate tensor to obtain the final clustering results different from the traditional algorithm solving the approximation function with a greedy strategy we utilize a non greedy strategy to obtain a better solution experiments demonstrate that rtc has better performance than the state of the art algorithms and is more robust to outliers

central clustering of categorical data with automated feature weighting  1260
lifei chen shengrui wang

the ability to cluster high dimensional categorical data is essential for many machine learning applications such as bioinfomatics currently central clustering of categorical data is a difficult problem due to the lack of a geometrically interpretable definition of a cluster center in this paper we propose a novel kernel density based definition using a bayes type probability estimator then a new algorithm called k centers is proposed for central clustering of categorical data incorporating a new feature weighting scheme by which each attribute is automatically assigned with a weight measuring its individual contribution for the clusters experimental results on real world data show outstanding performance of the proposed algorithm especially in recognizing the biological patterns in dna sequences

dimensionality reduction with generalized linear models  1267
mo chen wei li wei zhang xiaogang wang

in this paper we propose a general dimensionality reduction method for data generated from a very broad family of distributions and nonlinear functions based on the generalized linear model called generalized linear principal component analysis glpca data of different domains often have very different structures these data can be modeled by different distributions and reconstruction functions for example real valued data can be modeled by the gaussian distribution with a linear reconstruction function whereas binary valued data may be more appropriately modeled by the bernoulli distribution with a logit or probit function based on general linear models we propose a unified framework for extracting features from data of different domains a general optimization algorithm based on natural gradient ascent on distribution manifold is proposed for obtaining the maximum likelihood solutions we also present some specific algorithms derived from this framework to deal with specific data modeling problems such as document modeling experimental results of these algorithms on several data sets are shown for the validation of glpca

generalized relational topic models with data augmentation  1273
ning chen jun zhu fei xia bo zhang

relational topic models have shown promise on analyzing document network structures and discovering latent topic representations this paper presents three extensions 1 unlike the common link likelihood with a diagonal weight matrix that allows the same topic interactions only we generalize it to use a full weight matrix that captures all pairwise topic interactions and is applicable to asymmetric networks 2 instead of doing standard bayesian inference we perform regularized bayesian inference with a regularization parameter to deal with the imbalanced link structure issue in common real networks and 3 instead of doing variational approximation with strict mean field assumptions we present a collapsed gibbs sampling algorithm for the generalized relational topic models without making restricting assumptions experimental results demonstrate the significance of these extensions on improving the prediction performance and the time efficiency can be dramatically improved with a simple fast approximation method

domain adaptation with topical correspondence learning  1280
zheng chen weixiong zhang

a serious and ubiquitous issue in machine learning is the lack of sufficient training data in a domain of interest domain adaptation isan effective approach to dealing with this problem by transferring information or models learned from related albeit distinct domains to the target domain we develop a novel domain adaptation method for text document classification under the framework of non negative matrix factorization two key ideas of our method are to construct a latent topic space where a topic is decomposed into common words shared by all domains and words specific to individual domains and then to establish associations between words in different domains through the common words as a bridge for knowledge transfer the correspondence between cross domain topics leads to more coherent distributions of source and target domains in the new representation while preserving the predictive power our new method outperformed several state of the art domain adaptation methods on several benchmark datasets

bayesian nonparametric feature construction for inverse reinforcement learning  1287
jaedeug choi kee eung kim

most of the algorithms for inverse reinforcement learning irl assume that the reward function is a linear function of the pre defined state and action features however it is often difficult to manually specify the set of features that can make the true reward function representable as a linear function we propose a bayesian nonparametric approach to identifying useful composite features for learning the reward function the composite features are assumed to be the logical conjunctions of the predefined atomic features so that we can represent the reward function as a linear function of the composite features we empirically show that our approach is able to learn composite features that capture important aspects of the reward function on synthetic domains and predict taxi drivers behaviour with high accuracy on a real gps trace dataset

in many problem settings for example on graph domains online learning algorithms on streams of data need to respect strict time constraints dictated by the throughput on which the data arrive when only a limited amount of memory budget is available a learning algorithm will eventually need to discard some of the information used to represent the current solution thus negatively affecting its classification performance more importantly the overhead due to budget management may significantly increase the computational burden of the learning algorithm in this paper we present a novel approach inspired by the passive aggressive and the lossy counting algorithms our algorithm uses a fast procedure for deleting the less influential features moreover it is able to estimate the weighted frequency of each feature and use it for prediction

bootstrap learning via modular concept discovery  1302
eyal dechter jon malmaud ryan p adams joshua b tenenbaum

suppose a learner is faced with a domain of problems about which it knows nearly nothing it does not know the distribution of problems the space of solutions is not smooth and the reward signal is uninformative providing perhaps a few bits of information but not enough to steer the learner effectively how can such a learner ever get off the ground a common intuition is that if the solutions to these problems share a common structure and the learner can solve some simple problems by brute force it should be able to extract useful components from these solutions and by composing them explore the solution space more efficiently here we formalize this intuition where the solution space is that of typed functional programs and the gained information is stored as a stochastic grammar over programs we propose an iterative procedure for exploring such spaces in the first step of each iteration the learner explores a finite subset of the domain guided by a stochastic grammar in the second step the learner compresses the successful solutions from the first step to estimate a new stochastic grammar we test this procedure on symbolic regression and boolean circuit learning and show that the learner discovers modular concepts for these domains whereas the learner is able to solve almost none of the posed problems in the procedures first iteration it rapidly becomes able to solve a large number by gaining abstract knowledge of the structure of the solution space

liang du yi dong shen

nonnegative matrix tri factorization nmtf and its graph regularized extensions have been widely used for co clustering task to group data points and features simultaneously however existing methods are sensitive to noises and outliers which are because of the squared loss function is used to measure the quality of data reconstruction and graph regularization in this paper we extend gnmtf by introducing a sparse outlier matrix into the data reconstruction function and applying the l1 norm to measure graph dual regularization errors which leads to a novel robust co clustering rcc method accordingly rcc is expected to obtain a more faithful approximation to the data recovered from sparse outliers and achieve robust regularization by reducing the regularization errors of unreliable graphs via 1norm to solve the optimization problem of rcc an alternating iterative algorithm is provided and its convergence is also proved we also show the connection between the sparse outlier matrix in data reconstruction function and the robust huber m estimator experimental results on real world data sets show that our rcc consistently outperforms the other algorithms in terms of clustering performance which validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach

wentao fan nizar bouguila

during the past decade finite mixture modeling has become a well established technique in data analysis and clustering this paper focus on developing a variational inference framework to learn finite beta liouville mixture models that have been proposed recently as an efficient way for proportional data clustering in contrast to the conventional expectation maximization em algorithm commonly used for learning finite mixture models the proposed algorithm has the advantages that it is more efficient from a computational point of view and by preventing over  and under fitting problems moreover the complexity of the mixture model ie the number of components can be determined automatically and simultaneously with the parameters estimation in a closed form as part of the bayesian inference procedure the merits of the proposed approach are shown using both artificial data sets and two interesting and challenging real applications namely dynamic textures clustering and facial expression recognition

wei gao zhi hua zhou

most studies were devoted to the design of efficient algorithms and the evaluation and application on diverse ranking problems whereas few work has been paid to the theoretical studies on ranking learnability in this paper we study the relation between uniform convergence stability and learnability of ranking in contrast to supervised learning where the learnability is equivalent to uniform convergence we show that the ranking uniform convergence is sufficient but not necessary for ranking learnability with aerm and we further present a sufficient condition for ranking uniform convergence with respect to bipartite ranking loss considering the ranking uniform convergence being unnecessary for ranking learnability we prove that the ranking average stability is a necessary and sufficient condition for ranking learnability

alkis gotovos nathalie casati gregory hitz andreas krause

many information gathering problems require determining the set of points for which an unknown function takes value above or below some given threshold level we formalize this task as a classification problem with sequential measurements where the unknown function is modeled as a sample from a gaussian process gp we propose lse an algorithm that guides both sampling and classification based on gp derived confidence bounds and provide theoretical guarantees about its sample complexity furthermore we extend lse and its theory to two more natural settings 1 where the threshold level is implicitly defined as a percentage of the unknown maximum of the target function and 2 where samples are selected in batches we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods on two problems of practical interest namely autonomous monitoring of algal populations in a lake environment and geolocating network latency

tias guns anton dries guido tack siegfried nijssen luc de raedt

we introduce miningzinc a general framework for constraint based pattern mining one of the most popular tasks in data mining miningzinc consists of two key components a language component and a toolchain component the language allows for high level and natural modeling of mining problems such that miningzinc models closely resemble definitions found in the data mining literature it is inspired by the zinc family of languages and systems and supports user defined constraints and optimization criteria the toolchain allows for finding solutions to the models it ensures the solver independence of the language and supports both standard constraint solvers and specialized data mining systems automatic model transformations enable the efficient use of different solvers and systems the combination of both components allows one to rapidly model constraint based mining problems and execute these with a wide variety of methods we demonstrate this experimentally for a number of well known solvers and data mining tasks

yuhong guo wei xue

multi label classification is a critical problem in many areas of data analysis such as image labeling and text categorization in this paper we propose a probabilistic multi label classification model based on novel sparse feature learning by employing an individual sparsity inducing ℓ1 norm and a group sparsity inducing ℓ21 norm the proposed model has the capacity of capturing both label interdependencies and common predictive model structures we formulate this sparse norm regularized learning problem as a non smooth convex optimization problem and develop a fast proximal gradient algorithm to solve it for an optimal solution our empirical study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method on a set of multi label tasks given a limited number of labeled training instances

yahong han yi yang xiaofang zhou

supervised feature selection determines feature relevance by evaluating features correlation with the classes joint minimization of a classifiers loss function and an l21 norm regularization has been shown to be effective for feature selection however the appropriate feature subset learned from different classifiers loss function may be different less effort has been made on improving the performance of feature selection by the ensemble of different classifiers criteria and take advantages of them furthermore for the cases when only a few labeled data per class are available over fitting would be a potential problem and the performance of each classifier is restrained in this paper we add a joint l21 norm on multiple feature selection matrices to ensemble different classifiers loss function into a joint optimization framework this added co regularization term has twofold role in enhancing the effect of regularization for each criterion and uncovering common irrelevant features the problem of over fitting can be alleviated and thus the performance of feature selection is improved extensive experiment on different data types demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm

jingrui he wei shen phani divakaruni laura wynter rick lawrence

road traffic prediction is a critical component in modern smart transportation systems it provides the basis for traffic management agencies to generate proactive traffic operation strategies for alleviating congestion existing work on near term traffic prediction forecasting horizons in the range of 5 minutes to 1 hour relies on the past and current traffic conditions however once the forecasting horizon is beyond 1 hour ie in longer term traffic prediction these techniques do not work well since additional factors other than the past and current traffic conditions start to play important roles to address this problem in this paper for the first time we examine whether it is possible to use the rich information in online social media to improve longer term traffic prediction to this end we first analyze the correlation between traffic volume and tweet counts with various granularities then we propose an optimization framework to extract traffic indicators based on tweet semantics using a transformation matrix and incorporate them into traffic prediction via linear regression experimental results using traffic and twitter data originated from the san francisco bay area of california demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework

a general framework for interacting bayes optimally with self interested agents using arbitrary parametric model and model prior  1394
trong nghia hoang kian hsiang low

recent advances in bayesian reinforcement learning brl have shown that bayes optimality is theoretically achievable by modeling the environments latent dynamics using flat dirichlet multinomial fdm prior in self interested multi agent environments the transition dynamics are mainly controlled by the other agents stochastic behavior for which fdms independence and modeling assumptions do not hold as a result fdm does not allow the other agents behavior to be generalized across different states nor specified using prior domain knowledge to overcome these practical limitations of fdm we propose a generalization of brl to integrate the general class of parametric models and model priors thus allowing practitioners domain knowledge to be exploited to produce a fine grained and compact representation of the other agents behavior empirical evaluation shows that our approach outperforms existing multi agent reinforcement learning algorithms

efficient kernel learning from side information using admm  1408
en liang hu james t kwok

side information is highly useful in the learning of a nonparametric kernel matrix however this often leads to an expensive semidefinite program sdp in recent years a umber of dedicated solvers have been proposed though much better than off the shelf sdp solvers they still cannot scale to large data sets in this paper we propose a novel solver based on the alternating direction method of multipliers admm the key idea is to use a low rank decomposition of the kernel matrix k  vt u with the constraint that v  u the resultant optimization problem though non convex has favorable convergence properties and can be efficiently solved without requiring eigen decomposition in each iteration experimental results on a number of real world data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is as accurate as directly solving the sdp but can be one to two orders of magnitude faster

yao hu debing zhang zhongming jin deng cai xiaofei he

in many real world scenarios active learning methods are used to select the most informative points for labeling to reduce the expensive human action one direction for active learning is selecting the most representative points ie selecting the points that other points can be approximated by linear combination of the selected points however these methods fails to consider the local geometrical information of the data space in this paper we propose a novel framework named active learning via neighborhood reconstruction alnr by taking into account the locality information directly during the selection specifically for the linear reconstruction of target point the nearer neighbors should have a greater effect and the selected points distant from the target point should be penalized severely we further develop an efficient two stage iterative procedure to solve the final optimization problem our empirical study shows encouraging results of the proposed algorithms in comparison to other state of the art active learning algorithms on both synthetic and real visual data sets

long kai huang qiang yang wei shi zheng

hash function learning has been recently received more and more attentions in fast search for large scale data however existing popular learning based hashing methods are batch based learning models and thus incur large scale computational problem for learning an optimal model on a large scale of labelled data and cannot handle data which comes sequentially in this paper we address the problem by developing an online hashing learning algorithm to get hashing model accommodate to each new pair of data at the same time the new updated hash model is penalized by the last learned model in order to retain important information learned in previous rounds we also derive a tight bound for the cumulative loss of our proposed online learning algorithm the experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed online hashing model on searching both metric distance neighbors and semantical similar neighbors in the experiments

discovering different types of topics factored topic models  1429
yun jiang ashutosh saxena

in traditional topic models such as lda a word is generated by choosing a topic from a collection however existing topic models do not identify different types of topics in a document such as topics that represent the content and topics that represent the sentiment in this paper our goal is to discover such different types of topics if they exist we represent our model as several parallel topic models called topic factors where each word is generated from topics from these factors jointly since the latent membership of the word is now a vector the learning algorithms become challenging we show that using a variational approximation still allows us to keep the algorithm tractable our experiments over several datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms many classic topic models while also discovering fewer more meaningful topics

prior free exploration bonus for and beyond near bayes optimal behavior  1437
kenji kawaguchi hiroshi sato

we study bayesian reinforcement learning rl as a solution of the exploration exploitation dilemma as full bayesian planning is intractable except for special cases previous work has proposed several approximation methods however these were often computationally expensive or limited to dirichlet priors in this paper we propose a new algorithm that is fast and of polynomial time for near bayesian optimal policy with any prior distributions that are not greatly misspecified perhaps even more interestingly the proposed algorithm can naturally avoid being misled by incorrect beliefs while effectively utilizing useful parts of prior information it can work well even when an utterly misspecified prior is assigned in that case the algorithm will follow pac mdp behavior instead if an existing pac mdp algorithm does so the proposed algorithm naturally outperformed other algorithms compared with it on a standard benchmark problem

causal inference with rare events in large scale time series data  1444
samantha kleinberg

large scale observational datasets are prevalent in many areas of research including biomedical informatics computational social science and finance however our ability to use these data for decision making lags behind our ability to collect and mine them one reason for this is the lack of methods for inferring the causal impact of rare events in cases such as the monitoring of continuous data streams from intensive care patients social media or finance though rare events may in fact be the most important ones — signaling critical changes in a patients status or trading volume while prior data mining approaches can identify or predict rare events they cannot determine their impact and probabilistic causal inference methods fail to handle inference with infrequent events instead we develop a new approach to finding the causal impact of rare events that leverages the large amount of data available to infer a model of a systems functioning and evaluates how rare events explain deviations from usual behavior using simulated data we evaluate the approach and compare it against others demonstrating that it can accurately infer the effects of rare events

active learning for teaching a robot grounded relational symbols  1451
johannes kulick marc toussaint tobias lang manuel lopes

we investigate an interactive teaching scenario where a human teaches a robot symbols which abstract the geometric properties of objects there are multiple motivations for this scenario first state of the art methods for relational reinforcement learning demonstrate that we can learn and employ strongly generalizing abstract models with great success for goal directed object manipulation however these methods rely on given grounded action and state symbols and raise the classical question where do the symbols come from second existing research on learning from human robot interaction has focused mostly on the motion level eg imitation learning however if the goal of teaching is to enable the robot to autonomously solve sequential manipulation tasks in a goal directed manner the human should have the possibility to teach the relevant abstractions to describe the task and let the robot eventually leverage powerful relational rl methods in this paper we formalize human robot teaching of grounded symbols as an active learning problem where the robot actively generates pick and place geometric situations that maximize its information gain about the symbol to be learned we demonstrate that the learned symbols can be used by a robot in a relational rl framework to learn probabilistic relational rules and use them to solve object manipulation tasks in a goal directed manner

adaptive thresholding in structure learning of a bayesian network  1458
boaz lerner michal afek rafi bojmel

thresholding a measure in conditional independence ci tests using a fixed value enables learning and removing edges as part of learning a bayesian network structure however the learned structure is sensitive to the threshold that is commonly selected 1 arbitrarily 2 irrespective of characteristics of the domain and 3 fixed for all ci tests we analyze the impact on mutual information – a ci measure – of factors such as sample size degree of variable dependence and variables cardinalities following we suggest to adaptively threshold individual tests based on the factors we show that adaptive thresholds better distinguish between pairs of dependent variables and pairs of independent variables and enable learning structures more accurately and quickly than when using fixed thresholds

a bayesian factorised covariance model for image analysis  1465
jun li dacheng tao

this paper presents a specialised bayesian model for analysing the covariance of data that are observed in the form of matrices which is particularly suitable for images compared to existing general purpose covariance learning techniques we exploit the fact that the variables are organised as an array with two sets of ordered indexes which induces innate relationship between the variables specifically we adopt a factorised structure for the covariance matrix the covariance of two variables is represented by the product of the covariance of the two corresponding rows and that of the two columns the factors ie the row wise and column wise covariance matrices are estimated by bayesian inference with sparse priors empirical study has been conducted on image analysis the model first learns correlations between the rows and columns in an image plane then the correlations between individual pixels can be inferred by their locations this scheme utilises the structural information of an image and benefits the analysis when the data are damaged or insufficient

xin li yuhong guo

multi label classification where each instance is assigned to multiple categories is a prevalent problem in data analysis however annotations of multi label instances are typically more time consuming or expensive to obtain than annotations of single label instances though active learning has been widely studied on reducing labeling effort for single label problems current research on multi label active learning remains in a preliminary state in this paper we first propose two novel multi label active learning strategies a max margin prediction uncertainty strategy and a label cardinality inconsistency strategy and then integrate them into an adaptive framework of multi label active learning our empirical results on multiple multi label data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed active instance selection strategies and the integrated active learning approach

jialu liu chi wang marina danilevsky jiawei han

graph clustering has received growing attention in recent years as an important analytical technique both due to the prevalence of graph data and the usefulness of graph structures for exploiting intrinsic data characteristicshowever as graph data grows in scale it becomes increasingly more challenging to identify clusters in this paper we propose an efficient clustering algorithm for large scale graph data using spectral methods the key idea is to repeatedly generate a small number of "supernodes" connected to the regular nodes in order to compress the original graph into a sparse bipartite graph by clustering the bipartite graph using spectral methods we are able to greatly improve efficiency without losing considerable clustering power extensive experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach

li liu ling shao

recently the low cost microsoft kinect sensor which can capture real time high resolution rgb and depth visual information has attracted increasing attentions for a wide range of applications in computer vision existing techniques extract hand tuned features from the rgb and the depth data separately and heuristically fuse them which would not fully exploit the complementarity of both data sources in this paper we introduce an adaptive learning methodology to automatically extract holistic spatio temporal features simultaneously fusing the rgb and depth information from rgbd video data for visual recognition tasks we address this as an optimization problem using our proposed restricted graph based genetic programming rggp approach in which a group of primitive 3d operators are first randomly assembled as graph based combinations and then evolved generation by generation by evaluating on a set of rgbd video samples finally the best performed combination is selected as the near optimal representation for a pre defined task the proposed method is systematically evaluated on a new hand gesture dataset skig that we collected ourselves and the public msrdailyactivity3d dataset respectively extensive experimental results show that our approach leads to significant advantages compared with state of the art handcrafted and machine learned features

zhiwu lu yuxin peng

this paper presents a novel semantic regularized matrix factorization method for learning descriptive visual bag of words bow representation although very influential in image classification the traditional visual bow representation has one distinct drawback that is for efficiency purposes this visual representation is often generated by directly clustering the low level visual feature vectors extracted from local key points or regions without considering the high level semantics of images in other words this visual representation still suffers from the semantic gap and may lead to significant performance degradation in more challenging tasks eg classification of community contributed images with large intra class variations to overcome this drawback we develop a semantic regularized matrix factorization method for learning descriptive visual bow representation by adding laplacian regularization defined with the tags easy to access although noisy of community contributed images into matrix factorization experimental results on two benchmark datasets show the promising performance of the proposed method

pablo morales mombiela daniel hernández lobato alberto suárez

the problem of detecting the direction of time in vector autoregressive var processes using statistical techniques is considered by analogy to causal ar1 processes with non gaussian noise we conjecture that the distribution of the time reversed residuals of a linear var model is closer to a gaussian than the distribution of actual residuals in the forward direction experiments with simulated data illustrate the validity of the conjecture based on these results we design a decision rule for detecting the direction of var processes the correct direction in time forward is the one in which the residuals of the time series are less gaussian a series of experiments illustrate the superior results of the proposed rule when compared with other methods based on independence tests

this paper studies the problem of image annotation in a multi modal setting where both visual and textual information are available we propose multi modal multi instance multi label latent dirichlet allocation m3lda where the model consists of a visual label part a textual label part and a label topic part the basic idea is that the topic decided by the visual information and the topic decided by the textual information should be consistent leading to the correct label assignment particularly m3lda is able to annotate image regions thus provides a promising way to understand the relation between input patterns and output semantics experiments on corel5k and imageclef validate the effectiveness of the proposed method

adaptive loss minimization for semi supervised elastic embedding  1565
feiping nie hua wang heng huang chris ding

the semi supervised learning usually only predict labels for unlabeled data appearing in training data and cannot effectively predict labels for testing data never appearing in training set to handle this out of sample problem many inductive methods make a constraint such that the predicted label matrix should be exactly equal to a linear model in practice this constraint is too rigid to capture the manifold structure of data motivated by this deficiency we relax the rigid linear embedding constraint and propose to use an elastic embedding constraint on the predicted label matrix such that the manifold structure can be better explored to solve our new objective and also a more general optimization problem we study a novel adaptive loss with efficient optimization algorithm our new adaptive loss minimization method takes the advantages of both l1 norm and l2 norm and is robust to the data outlier under laplacian distribution and can efficiently learn the normal data under gaussian distribution experiments have been performed on image classification tasks and our approach outperforms other state of the art methods

feiping nie hua wang heng huang chris ding

labeling training data is quite time consuming but essential for supervised learning models to solve this problem the active learning has been studied and applied to select the informative and representative data points for labeling however during the early stage of experiments only a small number or none of labeled data points exist thus the most representative samples should be selected first in this paper we propose a novel robust active learning method to handle the early stage experimental design problem and select the most representative data points selecting the representative samples is an np hard problem thus we employ the structured sparsity inducing norm to relax the objective to an efficient convex formulation meanwhile the robust sparse representation loss function is utilized to reduce the effect of outliers a new efficient optimization algorithm is introduced to solve our non smooth objective with low computational cost and proved global convergence empirical results on both single label and multi label classification benchmark data sets show the promising results of our method

teppo niinimäki mikko koivisto

we present a new sampling approach to bayesian learning of the bayesian network structure like some earlier sampling methods we sample linear orders on nodes rather than directed acyclic graphs dags the key difference is that we replace the usual markov chain monte carlo mcmc method by the method of annealed importance sampling ais we show that ais is not only competitive to mcmc in exploring the posterior but also superior to mcmc in two ways it enables easy and efficient parallelization due to the independence of the samples and lower bounding of the marginal likelihood of the model with good probabilistic guarantees we also provide a principled way to correct the bias due to order based sampling by implementing a fast algorithm for counting the linear extensions of a given partial order

shirui pan xingquan zhu

recent years have witnessed an increasing number of applications involving data with structural dependency and graph representations for these applications it is very common that their class distribution is imbalanced with minority samples being only a small portion of the population such imbalanced class distributions impose significant challenges to the learning algorithms this problem is further complicated with the presence of noise or outliers in the graph data in this paper we propose an imbalanced graph boosting algorithm igboost that progressively selects informative subgraph patterns from imbalanced graph data for learning to handle class imbalance we take class distributions into consideration to assign different weight values to graphs the distance of each graph to its class center is also considered to adjust the weight to reduce the impact of noisy graph data the weight values are integrated into the iterative subgraph feature selection and margin learning process to achieve maximum benefits experiments on real world graph data with different degrees of class imbalance and noise demonstrate the algorithm performance

jian pu yu gang jiang jun wang xiangyang xue

multiple task learning mtl is becoming popular due to its theoretical advances and empirical successes the key idea of mtl is to explore the hidden relationships among multiple tasks to enhance learning performance recently many mtl algorithms have been developed and applied to various problems such as feature selection and kernel learning however most existing methods highly relied on certain assumptions of the task relationships for instance several works assumed that there is a major task group and several outlier tasks and used a decomposition approach to identify the group structure and outlier tasks simultaneously in this paper we adopt a more general formulation for mtl without making specific structure assumptions instead of performing model decomposition we directly impose an elastic net regularization with a mixture of the structure and outlier penalties and formulate the objective as an unconstrained convex problem to derive the optimal solution efficiently we propose to use an iteratively reweighted least square irls method with a preconditioned conjugate gradient which is computationally affordable for high dimensional data extensive experiments are conducted over both synthetic and real data and comparisons with several state of the art algorithms clearly show the superior performance of the proposed method

buyue qian xiang wang fei wang hongfei li jieping ye ian davidson

active learning has been extensively studied and shown to be useful in solving real problems the typical setting of traditional active learning methods is querying labels from an oracle this is only possible if an expert exists which may not be the case in many real world applications in this paper we focus on designing easier questions that can be answered by a non expert these questions poll relative information as opposed to absolute information and can be even generated from side information we propose an active learning approach that queries the ordering of the importance of an instances neighbors rather than its label we explore our approach on real datasets and make several interesting discoveries including that querying neighborhood information can be an effective question to ask and sometimes can even yield better performance than querying labels

multi dimensional causal discovery  1649
ulrich schaechtle kostas stathis stefano bromuri

we propose a method for learning causal relations within high dimensional tensor data as they are typically recorded in non experimental databases the method allows the simultaneous inclusion of numerous dimensions within the data analysis such as samples time and domain variables construed as tensors in such tensor data we exploit and integrate non gaussian models and tensor analytic algorithms in a novel way we prove that we can determine simple causal relations independently of how complex the dimensionality of the data is we rely on a statistical decomposition that flattens higher dimensional data tensors into matrices this decomposition preserves the causal information and is therefore suitable for structure learning of causal graphical models where a causal relation can be generalised beyond dimension for example over all time points related methods either focus on a set of samples for instantaneous effects or look at one sample for effects at certain time points we evaluate the resulting algorithm and discuss its performance both with synthetic and real world data

kazuhiro seki kuniaki uehara

the ever growing literature in biomedicine makes it virtually impossible for individuals to grasp all the information relevant to their interests since even experts knowledge is limited important associations among key biomedical concepts may remain unnoticed in the flood of information discovering those hidden associations is called hypothesis discovery this paper reports our approach to this problem taking advantage of a triangular chain of relations extracted from published knowledge we consider such chains of relations as implicit rules to generate potential hypotheses the generated hypotheses are then compared with newer knowledge for assessing their validity and if validated they are served as positive examples for learning a regression model to rank hypotheses this framework called supervised hypothesis discovery is tested on real world knowledge from the biomedical literature to demonstrate its effectiveness

noam slonim ehud aharoni koby crammer

hartigans method for k means clustering holds several potential advantages compared to the classical and prevalent optimization heuristic known as lloyds algorithm eg it was recently shown that the set of local minima of hartigans algorithm is a subset of those of lloyds method we develop a closed form expression that allows to establish hartigans method for k means clustering with any bregman divergence and further strengthen the case of preferring hartigans algorithm over lloyds algorithm specifically we characterize a range of problems with various noise levels of the inputs for which any random partition represents a local minimum for lloyds algorithm while hartigans algorithm easily converges to the correct solution extensive experiments on synthetic and real world data further support our theoretical analysis

yale song zhen wen ching yung lin randall davis

sequential anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the one class nature of the data ie data is collected from only one class and the temporal dependence in sequential data we present one class conditional random fields occrf for sequential anomaly detection that learn from a one class dataset and capture the temporal dependence structure in an unsupervised fashion we propose a hinge loss in a regularized risk minimization framework that maximizes the margin between each sequence being classified as "normal" and "abnormal" this allows our model to accept most but not all of the training data as normal yet keeps the solution space tight experimental results on a number of real world datasets show our model outperforming several baselines we also report an exploratory study on detecting abnormal organizational behavior in enterprise social networks

unlearning from demonstration  1699
keith sullivan ahmed elmolla bill squires sean luke

when doing learning from demonstration it is often the case that the demonstrator provides corrective examples to fix errant behavior by the agent or robot we present a set of algorithms which use this corrective data to identify and remove noisy examples in datasets which caused errant classifications and ultimately errant behavior the objective is to actually modify the source datasets rather than solely rely on the noise insensitivity of the classification algorithm this is particularly useful in the sparse datasets often found in learning from demonstration experiments our approach tries to distinguish between noisy misclassification and mere undersampling of the learning space if errors are a result of misclassification we potentially remove the responsible points and update the classifier we demonstrate our method on uci machine learning datasets at different levels of sparsity and noise using decision trees k nearest neighbor and support vector machines

non negative multiple matrix factorization  1713
koh takeuchi katsuhiko ishiguro akisato kimura hiroshi sawada

non negative matrix factorization nmf is a traditional unsupervised machine learning technique for decomposing a matrix into a set of bases and coefficients under the non negative constraint nmf with sparse constraints is also known for extracting reasonable components from noisy data however nmf tends to give undesired results in the case of highly sparse data because the information included in the data is insufficient to decompose our key idea is that we can ease this problem if complementary data are available that we could integrate into the estimation of the bases and coefficients in this paper we propose a novel matrix factorization method called non negative multiple matrix factorization nmmf which utilizes complementary data as auxiliary matrices that share the row or column indices of the target matrix the data sparse  ness is improved by decomposing the target and auxiliary matrices simultaneously since auxiliary matrices provide information about the bases and coefficients we formulate nmmf as a generalization of nmf and then present a parameter estimation procedure derived from the multiplicative up  date rule we examined nmmf in both synthetic and real data experiments the effect of the auxiliary matrices appeared in the improved nmmf performance we also confirmed that the bases that nmmf obtained from the real data were intuitive and reasonable thanks to the non negative constraint

this paper proposes a simple linear bayesian approach to reinforcement learning we show that with an appropriate basis a bayesian linear gaussian model is sufficient for accurately estimating the system dynamics and in particular when we allow for correlated noise policies are estimated by first sampling a transition model from the current posterior and then performing approximate dynamic programming on the sampled model this form of approximate thompson sampling results in good exploration in unknown environments the approach can also be seen as a bayesian generalisation of least squares policy iteration where the empirical transition matrix is replaced with a sample from the posterior

multi class learning with individual sparsity  1729
ben zion vatashsky koby crammer

multi class problems are everywhere given an input the goal is to predict one of a few possible classes most previous work reduced learning to minimizing the empirical loss over some training set and an additional regularization term prompting simple models or some other prior knowledge many learning regularizations promote sparsity that is small models or small number of features as performed in group lasso yet such models do not always represent the classes well in some problems for each class there is a small set of features that represents it well yet the union of these sets is not small we propose to use other regularizations that promote this type of sparsity analyze the generalization property of such formulations and show empirically that indeed these regularizations not only perform well but also promote such sparsity structure

coupled attribute analysis on numerical data  1736
can wang zhong she longbing cao

the usual representation of quantitative data is to formalize it as an information table which assumes the independence of attributes in real world data attributes are more or less interacted and coupled via explicit or implicit relationships limited research has been conducted on analyzing such attribute interactions which only describe a local picture of attribute couplings in an implicit way this paper proposes a framework of the coupled attribute analysis to capture the global dependency of continuous attributes such global couplings integrate the intra coupled interaction within an attribute ie the correlations between attributes and their own powers and inter coupled interaction among different attributes ie the correlations between attributes and the powers of others to form a coupled representation for numerical objects by the taylor like expansion this work makes one step forward towards explicitly addressing the global interactions of continuous attributes verified by the applications in data structure analysis data clustering and data classification substantial experiments on 13 uci data sets demonstrate that the coupled representation can effectively capture the global couplings of attributes and outperforms the traditional way supported by statistical analysis

online feature selection with dynamic features has become an active research area in recent years however in some real world applications such as image analysis and email spam filtering features may arrive by groups existing online feature selection methods evaluate features individually while existing group feature selection methods cannot handle online processing motivated by this we formulate the online group feature selection problem and propose a novel selection approach for this problem our proposed approach consists of two stages online intra group selection and online inter group selection in the intra group selection we use spectral analysis to select discriminative features in each group when it arrives in the inter group selection we use lasso to select a globally optimal subset of features this 2 stage procedure continues until there are no more features to come or some predefined stopping conditions are met extensive experiments conducted on benchmark and real world data sets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms other state of the art online feature selection methods

zuoguan wang siwei lyu gerwin schalk qiang ji

recent years have seen a great interest in using deep architectures for feature learning from data one drawback of the commonly used unsupervised deep feature learning methods is that for supervised or semi supervised learning tasks the information in the target variables are not used until the final stage when the classifier or regressor is trained on the learned features this could lead to over generalized features that are not competitive on the specific supervised or semi supervised learning tasks in this work we describe a new learning method that combines deep feature learning on mixed labeled and unlabeled data sets specifically we describe a weakly supervised learning method of a prior supervised convolutional stacked auto encoders pcsa of which information in the target variables is represented probabilistically using a gaussian bernoulli restricted boltzmann machine rbm we apply this method to the decoding problem of an ecog based brain computer interface bci system our experimental results show that pcsa achieves significant improvement in decoding performance on benchmark data sets compared to the unsupervised feature learning as well as to the current state of the art algorithms that are based on manually crafted features

euler clustering  1792
jian sheng wu wei shi zheng jian huang lai

by always mapping data from lower dimensional space into higher or even infinite dimensional space kernel k means is able to organize data into groups when data of different clusters are not linearly separable however kernel k means incurs the large scale computation due to the representation theorem ie keeping an extremely large kernel matrix in memory when using popular gaussian and spatial pyramid matching kernels which largely limits its use for processing large scale data also existing kernel clustering can be over fitted by outliers as well in this paper we introduce an euler clustering which can not only maintain the benefit of nonlinear modeling using kernel function but also significantly solve the large scale computational problem in kernel based clustering this is realized by incorporating euler kernel euler kernel is relying on a nonlinear and robust cosine metric that is less sensitive to outliers more important it intrinsically induces an empirical map which maps data onto a complex space of the same dimension euler clustering takes these advantages to measure the similarity between data in a robust way without increasing the dimensionality of data and thus solves the large scale problem in kernel k means we evaluate euler clustering and show its superiority against related methods on five publicly available datasets

multi instance multi label learning miml deals with data objects that are represented by a bag of instances and associated with a set of class labels simultaneously previous studies typically assume that for every training example all positive labels are tagged whereas the untagged labels are all negative in many real applications such as image annotation however the learning problem often suffers from weak label that is users usually tag only a part of positive labels and the untagged labels are not necessarily negative in this paper we propose the mimlwel approach which works by assuming that highly relevant labels share some common instances and the underlying class means of bags for each label are with a large margin experiments validate the effectiveness of mimlwel in handling the weak label problem

in this paper we propose a locality constrained and sparsity encouraged manifold fitting approach aiming at capturing the locally sparse manifold structure into neighborhood graph construction by exploiting a principled optimization model the proposed model formulates neighborhood graph construction as a sparse coding problem with the locality constraint therefore achieving simultaneous neighbor selection and edge weight optimization the core idea underlying our model is to perform a sparse manifold fitting task for each data point so that close by points lying on the same local manifold are automatically chosen to connect and meanwhile the connection weights are acquired by simple geometric reconstruction we term the novel neighborhood graph generated by our proposed optimization model m fitted graph since such a graph stems from sparse manifold fitting to evaluate the robustness and effectiveness ofm  fitted graphs we leverage graph based semisupervised learning as the testbed extensive experiments carried out on six benchmark datasets validate that the proposed m  fitted graph is superior to state of the art neighborhood graphs in terms of classification accuracy using popular graph based semi supervised learning methods

wei zhang ke zhang pan gu xiangyang xue

in many applications the data may be high dimensional represented by multiple features and associated with more than one labels embedding learning is an effective strategy for dimensionality reduction and for nearest neighbor search in massive datasets we propose a novel method to seek compact embedding that allows efficient retrieval with incompletely labeled multi view data based on multi graph laplacian we achieve the optimal combination of heterogeneous features to effectively describe data which exploits the feature correlations between different views we learn the embedding that preserves the neighborhood context in the original spaces and obtain the complete labels simultaneously inter label correlations are sufficiently leveraged in the proposed framework our goal is to find the maps from multiple input spaces to the compact embedding space and to the semantic concept space at the same time there is semantic gap between the input multi view feature spaces and the semantic concept space and the compact embedding space can be looked on as the bridge between the above spaces experimental evaluation on three real world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method

yu zhang dit yan yeung

multi task learning is a way of bringing inductive transfer studied in human learning to the machine learning community a central issue in multi task learning is to model the relationships between tasks appropriately and exploit them to aid the simultaneous learning of multiple tasks effectively while some recent methods model and learn the task relationships from data automatically only pairwise relationships can be represented by them in this paper we propose a new model called multi task high order relationship learning mthol which extends in a novel way the use of pairwise task relationships to high order task relationships we first propose an alternative formulation of an existing multi task learning method based on the new formulation we propose a high order generalization leading to a new prior for the model parameters of different tasks we then propose a new probabilistic model for multi task learning and validate it empirically on some benchmark datasets

alice x zheng mikhail bilenko

in virtually all machine learning applications hyper parameter tuning is required to maximize predictive accuracy such tuning is computationally expensive and the cost is further exacerbated by the need for multiple evaluations via cross validation or bootstrap at each configuration setting to guarantee statistically significant results this paper presents a simple general technique for improving the efficiency of hyper parameter tuning by minimizing the number of resampled evaluations at each configuration we exploit the fact that train test samples can easily be matched across candidate hyper parameter configurations this permits the use of paired hypothesis tests and power analysis that allow for statistically sound early elimination of suboptimal candidates to minimize the number of evaluations results on synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate that our method improves over competitors for discrete parameter settings and enhances state of the art techniques for continuous parameter settings

guoqiang zhong mohamed cheriet

error correcting output codes ecoc are a successful technique to combine a set of binary classifiers for multi class learning problems however in traditional ecoc framework all the base classifiers are trained independently according to the defined ecoc matrix in this paper we reformulate the ecoc models from the perspective of multi task learning where the binary classifiers are learned in a common subspace of data this novel model can be considered as an adaptive generalization of the traditional ecoc framework it simultaneously optimizes the representation of data as well as the binary classifiers more importantly it builds a bridge between the ecoc framework and multi task learning for multi class learning problems to deal with complex data we also present the kernel extension of the proposed model extensive empirical study on 14 data sets from uci machine learning repository and the usps handwritten digits recognition application demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our model

leon wenliang zhong james t kwok

in classification problemsisotonic regression has been commonly used to map the prediction scores to posterior class probabilities however isotonic regression may suffer from overfitting and the learned mapping is often discontinuous besides current efforts mainly focus on the calibration of a single classifier as different classifiers have different strengths a combination of themcan lead to better performance in this paper we propose a novel probability calibration approach for such an ensemble of classifiers we first construct isotonic constraints on the desired probabilities based on soft voting of the classifiers manifold information is also incorporated to combat overfitting and ensurefunction smoothness computationallythe extended isotonic regression model can be learned efficiently by a novel optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers admm experimentson a number of real world data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms independent classifiers and other combinations of the classifiers probabilities in terms of the brier score and auc

xiaojin zhu

persistent homology is a mathematical tool from topological data analysis it performs multi scale analysis on a set of points and identifies clusters holes and voids therein these latter topological structures complement standard feature representations making persistent homology an attractive feature extractor for artificial intelligence research on persistent homology for ai is in its infancy and is currently hindered by two issues the lack of an accessible introduction to ai researchers and the paucity of applications in response the first part of this paper presents a tutorial on persistent homology specifically aimed at a broader audience without sacrificing mathematical rigor the second part contains one of the first applications of persistent homology to natural language processing specifically our similarity filtration with time skeleton sifts algorithm identifies holes that can be interpreted as semantic "tie backs" in a text document providing a new document structure representation we illustrate our algorithm on documents ranging from nursery rhymes to novels and on a corpus with child and adolescent writings

fuzhen zhuang ping luo peifeng yin qing he zhongzhi shi

cross domain learning targets at leveraging the knowledge from source domains to train accurate models for the test data from target domains with different but related data distributions to tackle the challenge of data distribution difference in terms of raw features previous works proposed to mine high level concepts eg word clusters across data domains which shows to be more appropriate for classification however all these works assume that the same set of concepts are shared in the source and target domains in spite that some distinct concepts may exist only in one of the data domains thus we need a general framework which can incorporate both shared and distinct concepts for cross domain classification to this end we develop a probabilistic model by which both the shared and distinct concepts can be learned by the em process which optimizes the data likelihood to validate the effectiveness of this model we intentionally construct the classification tasks where the distinct concepts exist in the data domains the systematic experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model over all compared baselines especially on those much more challenging tasks

umair z ahmed sumit gulwani amey karkare

natural deduction which is a method for establishing validity of propositional type arguments helps develop important reasoning skills and is thus a key ingredient in a course on introductory logic we present two core components namely solution generation and practice problem generation for enabling computer aided education for this important subject domain the key enabling technology is use of an offline computed data structure called universal proof graph upg that encodes all possible applications of inference rules over all small propositions abstracted using their bitvector based truth table representation this allows an efficient forward search for solution generation more interestingly this allows generating fresh practice problems that have given solution characteristics by performing a backward search in upg we obtained around 300 natural deduction problems from various textbooks our solution generation procedure can solve many more problems than the traditional forward chaining based procedure while our problem generation procedure can efficiently generate several variants with desired characteristics

rajeev alur loris dantoni sumit gulwani dileep kini mahesh viswanathan

one challenge in making online education more effective is to develop automatic grading software that can provide meaningful feedback this paper provides a solution to automatic grading of the standard computation theory problem that asks a student to construct a deterministic finite automaton dfa from the given description of its language we focus on how to assign partial grades for incorrect answers each students answer is compared to the correct dfa using a hybrid of three techniques devised to capture different classes of errors first in an attempt to catch syntactic mistakes we compute the edit distance between the two dfa descriptions second we consider the entropy of the symmetric difference of the languages of the two dfas and compute a score that estimates the fraction of the number of strings on which the student answer is wrong our third technique is aimed at capturing mistakes in reading of the problem description for this purpose we consider a description language mosel which adds syntactic sugar to the classical monadic second order logic and allows defining regular languages in a concise and natural way we provide algorithms along with optimizations for transforming mosel descriptions into dfas and vice versa these allow us to compute the syntactic edit distance of the incorrect answer from the correct one in terms of their logical representations we report an experimental study that evaluates hundreds of answers submitted by real students by comparing gradesfeedback computed by our tool with human graders our conclusion is that the tool is able to assign partial grades in a meaningful way and should be preferred over the human graders for both scalability and consistency

utku sirin faruk polat reda alhajj

the goal of controlling a gene regulatory network grn is to generate an intervention strategy ie a control policy such that by applying the policy the system will avoid undesirable states in this work we propose a method to control grns by using batch mode reinforcement learning batch rl our idea is based on the fact that time series gene expression data can actually be interpreted as a sequence of experience tuples collected from the environment existing studies on this control task try to infer a model using gene expression data and then calculate a control policy over the constructed model however we propose a method that can directly use the available gene expression data to obtain an approximated control policy for gene regulation that avoids the time consuming model building phase results show that we can obtain policies for gene regulation systems of several thousands of genes just in several seconds while existing solutions get stuck for even tens of genes interestingly the reported results also show that our method produces policies that are almost as good as the ones generated by existing model dependent methods

alberto barrón cedeño lluís màrquez carlos a henríquez q lluís formiga enrique romero jonathan may

post editing feedback provided by users of on line translation services offers an excellent opportunity for automatic improvement of statistical machine translation smt systems however feedback provided by casual users is very noisy and must be automatically filtered in order to identify the potentially useful cases we present a study on automatic feedback filtering in a real weblog collected from reversonet we extend and re annotate a training corpus define an extended set of simple features and approach the problem as a binary classification task experimenting with linear and kernel based classifiers and feature selection results on the feedback filtering task show a significant improvement over the majority class but also a precision ceiling around 70 80 this reflects the inherent difficulty of the problem and indicates that shallow features cannot fully capture the semantic nature of the problem despite the modest results on the filtering task the classifiers are proven effective in an application based evaluation the incorporation of a filtered set of feedback instances selected from a larger corpus significantly improves the performance of a phrase based smt system according to a set of standard evaluation metrics

lexical cohesion arises from a chain of lexical items that establish links between sentences in a text in this paper we propose three different models to capture lexical cohesion for document level machine translation a a direct reward model where translation hypotheses are rewarded whenever lexical cohesion devices occur in them b a conditional probability model where the appropriateness of using lexical cohesion devices is measured and c a mutual information trigger model where a lexical cohesion relation is considered as a trigger pair and the strength of the association between the trigger and the triggered item is estimated by mutual information we integrate the three models into hierarchical phrase based machine translation and evaluate their effectiveness on the nist chinese english translation tasks with large scale training data experiment results show that all three models can achieve substantial improvements over the baseline and that the mutual information trigger model performs better than the others

rui yan han jiang mirella lapata shou de lin xueqiang lv xiaoming li

part of the long lasting cultural heritage of china is the classical ancient chinese poems which follow strict formats and complicated linguistic rules automatic chinese poetry composition by programs is considered as a challenging problem in computational linguistics and requires high artificial intelligence assistance and has not been well addressed in this paper we formulate the poetry composition task as an optimization problem based on a generative summarization framework under several constraints given the user specified writing intents the system retrieves candidate terms out of a large poem corpus and then orders these terms to fit into poetry formats satisfying tonal and rhythm requirements the optimization process under constraints is conducted via iterative term substitutions till convergence and outputs the subset with the highest utility as the generated poem for experiments we perform generation on large datasets of 61960 classic poems from tang and song dynasty of china a comprehensive evaluation using both human judgments and rouge scores has demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach

fusion of word and letter based metrics for automatic mt evaluation  2204
muyun yang junguo zhu sheng li tiejun zhao

with the progress in machine translation it becomes more subtle to develop the evaluation metric capturing the systems differences in comparison to the human translations in contrast to the current efforts in leveraging more linguistic information to depict translation quality this paper takes the thread of combining language independent features for a robust solution to mt evaluation metric to compete with finer granularity of modeling brought by linguistic features the proposed method augments the word level metrics by a letter based calculation an empirical study is then conducted over wmt data to train the metrics by ranking svm the results reveal that the integration of current language independent metrics can generate well enough performance for a variety of languages time split data validation is promising as a better training setting though the greedy strategy also works well

improving function word alignment with frequency and syntactic information  2211
jingyi zhang hai zhao

in statistical word alignment for machine translation function words usually cause poor aligning performance because they do not have clear correspondence between different languages this paper proposes a novel approach to improve word alignment by pruning alignments of function words from an existing alignment model with high precision and recall based on monolingual and bilingual frequency characteristics a language independent function word recognition algorithm is first proposed then a group of carefully defined syntactic structures combined with content word alignments are used for further function word alignment pruning the experimental results show that the proposed approach improves both the quality of word alignment and the performance of statistical machine translation on chinese to english german to english and french to english language pairs

cross lingual entity linking with bilingual topic model  2218
tao zhang kang liu jun zhao

cross lingual entity linking means linking an entity mention in a background source document in one language with the corresponding real world entity in a knowledge base written in the other language the key problem is to measure the similarity score between the context of the entity mention and the document of the candidate entity this paper presents a general framework for doing cross lingual entity linking by leveraging a large scale and bilingual knowledge base wikipedia we introduce a bilingual topic model that mining bilingual topic from this knowledge base with the assumption that the same wikipedia concept documents of two different languages share the same semantic topic distribution the extracted topics have two types of representation with each type corresponding to one language thus both the context of the entity mention and the document of the candidate entity can be represented in a space using the same semantic topics we use these topics to do cross lingual entity linking experimental results show that the proposed approach can obtain the competitive results compared with the state of art approach

integrating semantic relatedness and words intrinsic features for keyword extraction  2225
wei zhang wei feng jianyong wang

keyword extraction attracts much attention for its significant role in various natural language processing tasks while some existing methods for keyword extraction have considered using single type of semantic relatedness between words or inherent attributes of words almost all of them ignore two important issues 1 how to fuse multiple types of semantic relations between words into a uniform semantic measurement and automatically learn the weights of the edges between the words in the word graph of each document and 2 how to integrate the relations between words and words intrinsic features into a unified model in this work we tackle the two issues based on the supervised random walk model we propose a supervised ranking based method for keyword extraction which is called seafarer it can not only automatically learn the weights of the edges in the unified graph of each document which includes multiple semantic relations but also combine the merits of semantic relations of edges and intrinsic attributes of nodes together we conducted extensive experimental study on an established benchmark and the experimental results demonstrate that seafarer outperforms the state of the art supervised and unsupervised methods

partial tree linearization generalized word ordering for text synthesis  2232
yue zhang

we present partial tree linearization a generalized word ordering ie ordering a set of input words into a grammatical and fluent sentence task for text to text applications recent studies of word ordering can be categorized into either abstract word ordering no input syntax except for pos or tree linearization input words are associated with a full unordered syntax tree partial tree linearization covers the whole spectrum of input between these two extremes by allowing pos and dependency relations to be associated with any subset of input words partial tree linearization is more practical for a dependency based nlg pipeline such as transfer based mt and abstractive text summarization in addition a partial tree linearizer can also perform abstract word ordering and full tree linearization our system achieves the best published results on standard ptb evaluations of these tasks

improving question retrieval in community question answering using world knowledge  2239
guangyou zhou yang liu fang liu daojian zeng jun zhao

community question answering cqa which provides a platform for people with diverse background to share information and knowledge has become an increasingly popular research topic in this paper we focus on the task of question retrievalthe key problem of question retrieval is to measure the similarity between the queried questions and the historical questions which have been solved by other users the traditional methods measure the similarity based on the bag of wordsbows representation this representation neither captures dependencies between related words nor handles synonyms or polysemous words in this work we first propose a way to build a concept thesaurus based on the semantic relations extracted from the world knowledge of wikipedia then we develop a unified framework to leverage these semantic relations in order to enhance the question similarity in the concept space experiments conducted on a real cqa data set show that with the help of wikipedia thesaurus the performance of question retrieval is improved as compared to the traditional methods

efficient latent structural perceptron with hybrid trees for semantic parsing  2246
junsheng zhou juhong xu weiguang qu

discriminative structured prediction models have been widely used in many natural language processing tasks but it is challenging to apply the methods to semantic parsing in this paper by introducing hybrid tree as a latent structure variable to close the gap between the input sentences and output representations we formulate semantic parsing as a structured prediction problem based on the latent variable perceptron model incorporated with a tree edit distance loss as optimization criterion the proposed approach maintains the advantage of a discriminative model in accommodating flexible combination of features and naturally incorporates an efficient decoding algorithm in learning and inference furthermore in order to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of inference we design an effective approach based on vector space model to extract a smaller subset of relevant mr productions for test examples experimental results on publicly available corpus show that our approach significantly outperforms previous systems

revisiting regression in planning  2254
vidal alcázar daniel borrajo susana fernández raquel fuentetaja

heuristic search with reachability based heuristics is arguably the most successful paradigm in automated planning to date in its earlier stages of development heuristic search was proposed as both forward and backward search due to the disadvantages of backward search in the last decade researchers focused mainly on forward search and backward search was abandoned for the most part as a valid alternative in the last years important advancements regarding both the theoretical understanding and the performance of heuristic search have been achieved applied mainly to forward search planners in this work we revisit regression in planning with reachability based heuristics trying to extrapolate to backward search current lines of research that were not as well understood as they are now

bridging the gap between refinement and heuristics in abstraction  2261
christer bäckström peter jonsson

there are two major uses of abstraction in planning and search refinement where abstract solutions are extended into concrete solutions and heuristics where abstract solutions are used to compute heuristics for the original search space these two approaches are usually viewed as unrelated in the literature it is reasonable to believe though that they are related since they are both intrinsically based on the structure of abstract search spaces we take the first steps towards formally investigating their relationships employing our recently introduced framework for analysing and comparing abstraction methods by adding some mechanisms for expressing metric properties we can capture concepts like admissibility and consistency of heuristics we present an extensive study of how such metric properties relate to the properties in the original framework revealing a number of connections between the refinement and heuristic approaches this also provides new insights into for example valtortas theorem and spurious states

an admissible heuristic for sas planning obtained from the state equation  2268
blai bonet

domain independent optimal planning has seen important breakthroughs in recent years with the development of tractable and informative admissible heuristics suitable for planners based on forward state space search these heuristics allow planners to optimally solve an important number of benchmark problems including problems that are quite involved and difficult for the layman in this paper we present a new admissible heuristic that is obtained from the state equation associated to the petri net representation of the planning problem the new heuristic that does not fall into one of the four standard classes can be computed in polynomial time and is competitive with the current state of the art for optimal planning as empirically demonstrated over a large number of problems mainly because it often shows an improved quality to cost ratio the new heuristic applies to sas planning tasks with arbitrary non negative action costs

causal belief decomposition for planning with sensing completeness results and practical approximation  2275
blai bonet hector geffner

belief tracking is a basic problem in planning with sensing while the problem is intractable it has been recently shown that for both deterministic and non deterministic systems expressed in compact form it can be done in time and space that are exponential in the problem width the width measures the maximum number of state variables that are all relevant to a given precondition or goal in this work we extend this result both theoretically and practically first we introduce an alternative decomposition scheme and algorithm with the same time complexity but different completeness guarantees whose space complexity is much smaller exponential in the causal width of the problem that measures the number of state variables that are causally relevant to a given precondition goal or observable second we introduce a fast meaningful and powerful approximation that trades completeness by speed and is both time and space exponential in the problem causal width it is then shown empirically that the algorithm combined with simple heuristics yields state of the art real time performance in domains with high widths but low causal widths such as minesweeper battleship and wumpus

isomorph free branch and bound search for finite state controllers  2282
marek grześ pascal poupart jesse hoey

the recent proliferation of smart phones and other wearable devices has lead to a surge of new mobile applications partially observable markov decision processes provide a natural framework to design applications that continuously make decisions based on noisy sensor measurements however given the limited battery life there is a need to minimize the amount of online computation this can be achieved by compiling a policy into a finite state controller since there is no need for belief monitoring or online search in this paper we propose a new branch and bound technique to search for a good controller in contrast to many existing algorithms for controllers our search technique is not subject to local optima we also show how to reduce the amount of search by avoiding the enumeration of isomorphic controllers and by taking advantage of suitable upper and lower bounds the approach is demonstrated on several benchmark problems as well as a smart phone application to assist persons with alzheimers to wayfind

optimal delete relaxed and semi relaxed planning with conditional effects  2291
patrik haslum

recently several methods have been proposed for optimal delete free planning we present an incremental compilation approach that enables these methods to be applied to problems with conditional effects which none of them support natively with an h solver for problems with conditional effects in hand we also consider adapting the h anytime lower bound function to use the more space efficient pcce compilation this avoids the memory limitation of the original h caused by its reliance on an exponential space compilation it also leads to improvements on some problems where memory is not an issue

interactive pomdp lite towards practical planning to predict and exploit intentions for interacting with self interested agents  2298
trong nghia hoang kian hsiang low

a key challenge in non cooperative multi agent systems is that of developing efficient planning algorithms for intelligent agents to interact and perform effectively among boundedly rational self interested agents eg humans the practicality of existing works addressing this challenge is being undermined due to either the restrictive assumptions of the other agents behavior the failure in accounting for their rationality or the prohibitively expensive cost of modeling and predicting their intentions to boost the practicality of research in this field we investigate how intention prediction can be efficiently exploited and made practical in planning thereby leading to efficient intention aware planning frameworks capable of predicting the intentions of other agents and acting optimally with respect to their predicted intentions we show that the performance losses incurred by the resulting planning policies are linearly bounded by the error of intention prediction empirical evaluations through a series of stochastic games demonstrate that our policies can achieve better and more robust performance than the state of the art algorithms

controlling the hypothesis space in probabilistic plan recognition  2306
froduald kabanza julien filion abder rezak benaskeur hengameh irandoust

the ability to understand the goals and plans of other agents is an important characteristic of intelligent behaviours in many contexts one of the approaches used to endow agents with this capability is the weighted model counting approach given a plan library and a sequence of observations this approach exhaustively enumerates plan execution models that are consistent with the observed behaviour the probability that the agent might be pursuing a particular goal is then computed as a proportion of plan execution models satisfying the goal the approach allows to recognize multiple interleaved plans but suffers from a combinatorial explosion of plan execution models which impedes its application to real world domains this paper presents a heuristic weighted model counting algorithm that limits the number of generated plan execution models in order to recognize goals quickly by computing their lower and upper bound likelihoods

lifelong learning for acquiring the wisdom of the crowd  2313
ece kamar ashish kapoor eric horvitz

predictive models play a key role for inference and decision making in crowdsourcing we present methods that can be used to guide the collection of data for enhancing the competency of such predictive models while using the models to provide a base crowdsourcing service we focus on the challenge of ideally balancing the goals of collecting data over time for learning and for improving task performance with the cost of workers contributions over the lifetime of the operation of a system we introduce the use of distributions over a set of predictive models to represent uncertainty about the dynamics of the world we employ a novel monte carlo algorithm to reason simultaneously about uncertainty about the world dynamics and the progression of task solution as workers are hired over time to optimize hiring decisions we evaluate the methodology with experiments on a challenging citizen science problem demonstrating how it balances exploration and exploitation over the lifetime of a crowdsourcing system

pareto based multiobjective ai planning  2321
mostepha khouadjia marc schoenauer vincent vidal johann dréo pierre savéant

real world problems generally involve several antagonistic objectives like quality and cost for design problems or makespan and cost for planning problems the only approaches to multiobjective ai planning rely on metrics that can incorporate several objectives in some linear combinations and metric sensitive planners that are able to give different plans for different metrics and hence to eventually approximate the pareto front of the multiobjective problem ie the set of optimal trade offs between the antagonistic objectives divide and evolve dae is an evolutionary planner that embeds a classical planner and feeds it with a sequence of subproblems of the problem at hand like all evolutionary algorithms dae can be turned into a pareto based multiobjective solver even though using an embedded planner that is not metric sensitive the pareto based multiobjective planner mo dae thus avoids the drawbacks of the aggregation method furthermore using yahsp as the embedded planner it outperforms in many cases the metric based approach using lpg metric sensitive planner as witnessed by experimental results on original multiobjective benchmarks built upon ipc 2011 domains

flexible execution of partial order plans with temporal constraints  2328
christian muise j christopher beck sheila a mcilraith

we propose a unified approach to plan execution and schedule dispatching that converts a plan which has been augmented with temporal constraints into a policy for dispatching our approach generalizes the original plan and temporal constraints so that the executor need only consider the subset of state that is relevant to successful execution of valid plan fragments we can accommodate a variety of calamitous and serendipitous changes to the state of the world by supporting the seamless re execution or omission of plan fragments without the need for costly replanning our methodology for plan generalization and online dispatching is a novel combination of plan execution and schedule dispatching techniques we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a prototype implementation and a series of experiments

towards a second generation random walk planner an experimental exploration  2336
hootan nakhost martin müller

random walks have become a popular component of recent planning systems the increased exploration is a valuable addition to more exploitative search methods such as greedy best first search gbfs a number of successful planners which incorporate random walks have been built the work presented here aims to exploit the experience gained from building those systems it begins a systematic study of the design space and alternative choices for building such a system and develops a new random walk planner from scratch with careful experiments along the way four major insights are 1 a high state evaluation frequency is usually superior to the endpoint only evaluation used in earlier systems 2 adjusting the restarting parameter according to the progress speed in the search space performs better than any fixed setting 3 biasing the action selection towards preferred operators of only the current state is better than monte carlo helpful actions which depend on the number of times an action has been a preferred operator in previous walks and 4 even simple forms of random walk planning can compete with gbfs

fair ltl synthesis for non deterministic systems using strong cyclic planners  2343
fabio patrizi nir lipovetzky hector geffner

we consider the problem of planning in environments where the state is fully observable actions have non deterministic effects and plans must generate infinite state trajectories for achieving a large class of ltl goals more formally we focus on the control synthesis problem under the assumption that the ltl formula to be realized can be mapped into a deterministic büchi automaton we show that by assuming that action non determinism is fair namely that infinite executions of a non deterministic action in the same state yield each possible successor state an infinite number of times the fair synthesis problem can be reduced to a standard strong cyclic planning task over reachability goals since strong cyclic planners are built on top of efficient classical planners the transformation reduces the non deterministic fully observable temporally extended planning task into the solution of classical planning problems a number of experiments are reported showing the potential benefits of this approach to synthesis in comparison with state of the art symbolic methods

fault tolerant planning under uncertainty  2350
luis pineda yi lu shlomo zilberstein claudia v goldman

a fault represents some erroneous operation of a system that could result from an action selection error or some abnormal condition we formally define error models that characterize the likelihood of various faults and consider the problem of fault tolerant planning which optimizes performance given an error model we show that factoring the possibility of errors significantly degrades the performance of stochastic planning algorithms such as lao because the number of reachable states grows dramatically we introduce an approach to plan for a bounded number of faults and analyze its theoretical properties when combined with a continual planning paradigm the k fault tolerant planning method can produce near optimal performance even when the number of faults exceeds the bound empirical results in two challenging domains confirm the effectiveness of the approach in handling different types of runtime errors

getting the most out of pattern databases for classical planning  2357
florian pommerening gabriele röger malte helmert

the ipdb procedure by haslum et al is the state of the art method for computing additive abstraction heuristics for domain independent planning it performs a hill climbing search in the space of pattern collections combining information from multiple patterns in the so called canonical heuristic we show how stronger heuristic estimates can be obtained through linear programming an experimental evaluation demonstrates the strength of the new technique on the ipc benchmark suite

jussi rintanen charles orgill gretton

we describe an approach to computing upper bounds on the lengths of solutions to reachability problems in transition systems it is based on a decomposition of state variable dependency graphs causal graphs our approach is able to find practical upper bounds in a number of planning benchmarks computing the bounds is computationally cheap in practice and in a number of benchmarks our algorithm runs in polynomial time in the number of actions and propositional variables that characterize the problem

exploring knowledge engineering strategies in designing and modelling a road traffic accident management domain  2373
mohammad m shah lukáš chrpa diane kitchin thomas l mccluskey mauro vallati

formulating knowledge for use in ai planning engines is currently something of an ad hoc process where the skills of knowledge engineers and the tools they use may significantly influence the quality of the resulting planning application there is little in the way of guidelines or standard procedures however for knowledge engineers to use when formulating knowledge into planning domain languages such as pddl this paper seeks to investigate this process using as a case study a road traffic accident management domain managing road accidents requires systematic sound planning and coordination of resources to improve outcomes for accident victims we have derived a set of requirements in consultation with stakeholders for the resource coordination part of managing accidents we evaluate two separate knowledge engineering strategies for encoding the resulting planning domain from the set of requirements a the traditional method of pddl experts and text editor and b a leading planning gui with built in uml modelling tools these strategies are evaluated using process and product metrics where the domain model the product was tested extensively with a range of planning engines the results give insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches highlight lessons learned regarding knowledge encoding and point to important lines of research for knowledge engineering for planning

the godel planning system a more perfect union of domain independent and hierarchical planning  2380
vikas shivashankar ron alford ugur kuter dana nau

one drawback of hierarchical task network htn planning is the difficulty of providing complete domain knowledge ie a complete and correct set of htn methods for every task to provide a principled way to overcome this difficulty we define a simple formalism that extends classical planning to include problem decomposition using methods and a planning algorithm based on this formalism in our formalism the methods specify ways to achieve goals rather than tasks as in conventional htn planning and goals may be achieved even when no methods are available our planning algorithm godel goal decomposition with landmarks is sound and complete irrespective of whether the domain knowledge ie the set of methods given to the planner is complete by comparing godels performance with varying amounts of domain knowledge across three benchmark planning domains we show experimentally that 1 godel works correctly with partial planning knowledge 2 godels performance improves as more planning knowledge is given and 3 when given full domain knowledge godel matches the performance of a state of the art hierarchical planner

plan quality optimisation via block decomposition  2387
fazlul hasan siddiqui patrik haslum

ai planners have to compromise between the speed of the planning process and the quality of the generated plan anytime planners try to balance these objectives by finding plans of better quality over time but current anytime planners often do not make effective use of increasing runtime beyond a certain limit we present a new method of continuing plan improvement that works by repeatedly decomposing a given plan into subplans and optimising each subplan locally the decomposition exploits block structured plan deordering to identify coherent subplans which make sense to treat as units this approach extends the "anytime capability" of current planners   to provide continuing plan quality improvement at any time scale

symbolic merge and shrink for cost optimal planning  2394
Álvaro torralba carlos linares lópez daniel borrajo

symbolic pdbs and merge and shrink ms are two approaches to derive admissible heuristics for optimal planning we present a combination of these techniques symbolic merge and shrink sms which uses ms abstractions as a relaxation criterion for a symbolic backward search empirical evaluation shows that sms has the strengths of both techniques deriving heuristics at least as good as the best of them for most domains

problem splitting using heuristic search in landmark orderings  2401
simon vernhes guillaume infantes vincent vidal

in this paper we revisit the idea of splitting a planning problem into subproblems hopefully easier to solve with the help of landmark analysis while this technique initially proposed in the first approaches related to landmarks has been outperformed by landmark based heuristics we believe that it is still a promising research direction to this end we propose a new method for problem splitting based on landmarks which has two advantages over the original technique it is complete if a solution exists the algorithm finds it and it uses the precedence relation over the landmarks in a more flexible way we lay in this paper the foundations of a meta best first search algorithm which explores the landmark orderings to create subproblems and can use any embedded planner to solve subproblems it opens up avenues for future research among them are new heuristics for guiding the meta search towards the most promising orderings different policies for generating subproblems and influence of the embedded subplanner

run time improvement of point based pomdp policies  2408
minlue wang richard dearden

the most successful recent approaches to partially observable markov decision problem pomdp solving have largely been point based approximation algorithms these work by selecting a finite number of belief points computing alpha vectors for those points and using the resulting policy everywhere however if during execution the belief state is far from the points there is no guarantee that the policy will be good this case occurs either when the points are chosen poorly or there are too few points to capture the whole optimal policy for example in domains where there are many low probability transitions such as faults or exogenous events in this paper we explore the use of an on line plan repair approach to overcome this difficulty the idea is to split computation between off line plan creation and if necessary on line plan repair we evaluate a variety of heuristics used to determine when plan repair might be useful and then repair the plan by sampling a small number of additional belief points and recomputing the policy we show in several domains that the approach is more effective than either off line planning alone even with much more computation time or a purely on line planning based on forward search we also show that the overhead of checking the heuristics is very small when replanning is unnecessary

interactive value iteration for markov decision processes with unknown rewards  2415
paul weng bruno zanuttini

to tackle the potentially hard task of defining the reward function in a markov decision process we propose a new approach based on value iteration which interweaves the elicitation and optimization phases we assume that rewards whose numeric values are unknown can only be ordered and that a tutor is present to help comparing sequences of re  wards we first show how the set of possible reward functions for a given preference relation can be rep  resented as a polytope then our algorithm called interactive value iteration searches for an optimal policy while refining its knowledge about the pos  sible reward functions by querying a tutor when necessary we prove that the number of queries needed before finding an optimal policy is upper  bounded by a polynomial in the size of the problem and we present experimental results which demon  strate that our approach is efficient in practice

flexibility and decoupling in the simple temporal problem  2422
michel wilson tomas klos cees witteveen bob huisman

in this paper we concentrate on finding a suitable metric to determine the flexibility of a simple temporal problem stp after reviewing some flexibility metrics that have been proposed we conclude that these metrics fail to capture the correlation between events specified in the stp resulting in an overestimation of the available flexibility in the system we propose to use an intuitively more acceptable flexibility metric based upon uncorrelated time intervals for the allowed starting times of events in an stp this metric is shown to be computable in low polynomial time as a byproduct of the flexibility computation we get a decomposition of the stn almost for free for every possible k partitioning of the event space a decomposition can be computed in ok time even more importantly we show that contrary to popular belief such a decomposition does not affect the flexibility of the original stp

continuously relaxing over constrained conditional temporal problems through generalized conflict learning and resolution  2429
peng yu brian williams

over constrained temporal problems are commonly encountered while operating autonomous and decision support systems an intelligent system must learn a humans preference over a problem in order to generate preferred resolutions that minimize perturbation we present the best first conflict directed relaxation bcdr algorithm for enumerating the best continuous relaxation for an over constrained conditional temporal problem with controllable choices bcdr reformulates such a problem by making its temporal constraints relaxable and solves the problem using a conflict directed approach it extends the conflict directed a cd a algorithm to conditional temporal problems by first generalizing the conflict learning process to include all discrete variable assignments and continuous temporal constraints and then by guiding the forward search away from known infeasible regions using conflict resolution when evaluated empirically on a range of coordinated car sharing network problems bcdr demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance and solution quality compared to previous conflict directed approaches

robust optimization for hybrid mdps with state dependent noise  2437
zahra zamani scott sanner karina valdivia delgado leliane nunes de barros

recent advances in solutions to hybrid mdps with discrete and continuous state and action spaces have significantly extended the class of mdps for which exact solutions can be derived albeit at the expense of a restricted transition noise model in this paper we work around limitations of previous solutions by adopting a robust optimization approach in which nature is allowed to adversarially determine transition noise within pre specified confidence intervals this allows one to derive an optimal policy with an arbitrary user specified level of success probability and significantly extends the class of transition noise models for which hybrid mdps can be solved this work also significantly extends results for the related "chance constrained" approach in stochastic hybrid control to accommodate state dependent noise we demonstrate our approach working on a variety of hybrid mdps taken from ai planning operations research and control theory noting that this is the first time robust solutions with strong guarantees over all states have been automatically derived for such problems

action model acquisition from noisy plan traces  2444
hankz hankui zhuo subbarao kambhampati

there is increasing awareness in the planning community that the burden of specifying complete domain models is too high which impedes the applicability of planning technology in many real world domains although there have been many learning approaches that help automatically creating domain models they all assume plan traces training data are correct in this paper we aim to remove this assumption allowing plan traces to be with noise compared to collecting large amount of correct plan traces it is much easier to collect noisy plan traces eg we can directly exploit sensors to help collect noisy plan traces we consider a novel solution for this challenge that can learn action models from noisy plan traces we create a set of random variables to capture the possible correct plan traces behind the observed noisy ones and build a graphical model to describe the physics of the domain we then learn the parameters of the graphical model and acquire the domain model based on the learnt parameters in the experiment we empirically show that our approach is effective in several planning domains

refining incomplete planning domain models through plan traces  2451
hankz hankui zhuo tuan nguyen subbarao kambhampati

most existing work on learning planning models assumes that the entire model needs to be learned from scratch a more realistic situation is that the planning agent has an incomplete model which it needs to refine through learning in this paper we propose and evaluate a method for doing this our method takes as input an incomplete model with missing preconditions and effects in the actions as well as a set of plan traces that are known to be correct it outputs a refined model that not only captures additional preconditioneffect knowledge about the given actions but also macro actions we use a max sat framework for learning where the constraints are derived from the executability of the given plan traces as well as the preconditionseffects of the given incomplete model unlike traditional macro action learners which use macros to increase the efficiency of planning in the context of a complete model our motivation for learning macros is to increase the accuracy robustness of the plans generated with the refined model we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a systematic empirical evaluation

handling open knowledge for service robots  2459
xiaoping chen jianmin ji zhiqiang sui jiongkun xie

users may ask a service robot to accomplish various tasks so that the designer of the robot cannot program each of the tasks beforehand as more and more open source knowledge resources become available it is worthwhile trying to make use of open source knowledge resources for service robots the challenge lies in the autonomous identification acquisition and utilization of missing knowledge about a user task at hand in this paper the core problem is formalized and the complexity results of the main reasoning issues are provided a mechanism for task planning with open knowledge rules which are provided by non experts in semi structured natural language and thus generally underspecified are introduced techniques for translating the semi structured knowledge from a large open source knowledge base are also presented experiments showed a remarkable improvement of the system performance on a test set consisting of hundreds of user desires from the open source knowledge base

human action recognition using a temporal hierarchy of covariance descriptors on 3d joint locations  2466
mohamed e hussein marwan torki mohammad a gowayyed motaz el saban

human action recognition from videos is a challenging machine vision task with multiple important application domains such as human robotmachine interaction interactive entertainment multimedia information retrieval and surveillance in this paper we present a novel approach to human action recognition from 3d skeleton sequences extracted from depth data we use the covariance matrix for skeleton joint locations over time as a discriminative descriptor for a sequence to encode the relationship between joint movement and time we deploy multiple covariance matrices over sub sequences in a hierarchical fashion the descriptor has a fixed length that is independent from the length of the described sequence our experiments show that using the covariance descriptor with an off the shelf classification algorithm outperforms the state of the art in action recognition on multiple datasets captured either via a kinect type sensor or a sophisticated motion capture system we also include an evaluation on a novel large dataset using our own annotation

rolling dispersion for robot teams  2473
elizabeth a jensen maria gini

dispersing a team of robots into an unknown and dangerous environment such as a collapsed building can provide information about structural damage and locations of survivors and help rescuers plan their actions we propose a rolling dispersion algorithm which makes use of a small number of robots and achieves full exploration the robots disperse as much as possible while maintaining communication and then advance as a group leaving behind beacons to mark explored areas and provide a path back to the entrance the novelty of this algorithm comes from the manner in which the robots continue their exploration as a group after reaching the maximum dispersion possible while staying in contact with each other we use simulation to show that the algorithm works in multiple environments and for varying numbers of robots

accelerated robust point cloud registration in natural environments through positive and unlabeled learning  2480
maxime latulippe alexandre drouin philippe giguère françois laviolette

localization of a mobile robot is crucial for autonomous navigation using laser scanners this can be facilitated by the pairwise alignment of consecutive scans in this paper we are interested in improving this scan alignment in challenging natural environments for this purpose local descriptors are generally effective as they facilitate point matching however we show that in some natural environments many of them are likely to be unreliable which affects the accuracy and robustness of the results therefore we propose to filter the unreliable descriptors as a prior step to alignment our approach uses a fast machine learning algorithm trained on the fly under the positive and unlabeled learning paradigm without the need for human intervention our results show that the number of descriptors can be significantly reduced while increasing the proportion of reliable ones thus speeding up and improving the robustness of the scan alignment process

directing robot attention to recognise activities and to anticipate events like goal directed actions is a crucial skill for human robot interaction unfortunately issues like intrinsic time constraints the spatially distributed nature of the entailed information sources and the existence of a multitude of unobservable states affecting the system like latent intentions have long rendered achievement of such skills a rather elusive goal the problem tests the limits of current attention control systems it requires an integrated solution for tracking exploration and recognition which traditionally have been seen as separate problems in active visionwe propose a probabilistic generative framework based on a mixture of kalman filters and information gain maximisation that uses predictions in both recognition and attention control this framework can efficiently use the observations of one element in a dynamic environment to provide information on other elements and consequently enables guided explorationinterestingly the sensors control policy directly derived from first principles represents the intuitive trade off between finding the most discriminative clues and maintaining overall awarenessexperiments on a simulated humanoid robot observing a human executing goal oriented actions demonstrated improvement on recognition time and precision over baseline systems

hierarchical object discovery and dense modelling from motion cues in rgb d video  2502
jörg stückler sven behnke

in this paper we propose a novel method for object discovery and dense modelling in rgb d image sequences using motion cues we develop our method as a building block for active object perception such that robots can learn about the environment through perceiving the effects of actions our approach simultaneously segments rigid body motion within key views and discovers objects and hierarchical relations between object parts the poses of the key views are optimized in a graph of spatial relations to recover the rigid body motion trajectories of the camera with respect to the objects in experiments we demonstrate that our approach finds moving objects aligns partial views on the objects and retrieves hierarchical relations between the objects

learning visual symbols for parsing human poses in images  2510
fang wang yi li

parsing human poses in images is fundamental in extracting critical visual information for artificial intelligent agents our goal is to learn self contained body part representations from images which we call visual symbols and their symbol wise geometric contexts in this parsing process each symbol is individually learned by categorizing visual features leveraged by geometric information in the categorization we use latent support vector machine followed by an efficient cross validation procedure then these symbols naturally define geometric contexts of body parts in a fine granularity for effective inference when the structure of the compositional parts is a tree we derive an efficient approach to estimating human poses in images experiments on two large datasets suggest our approach outperforms state of the art methods

a consensual linear opinion pool  2518
arthur carvalho kate larson

an important question when eliciting opinions from experts is how to aggregate the reported opinions in this paper we propose a pooling method to aggregate expert opinions intuitively it works as if the experts were continuously updating their opinions in order to accommodate the expertise of others each updated opinion takes the form of a linear opinion pool where the weight that an expert assigns to a peers opinion is inversely related to the distance between their opinions in other words experts are assumed to prefer opinions that are close to their own opinions we prove that such an updating process leads to consensus ie the experts all converge towards the same opinion further we show that if rational experts are rewarded using the quadratic scoring rule then the assumption that they prefer opinions that are close to their own opinions follows naturally we empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method using real world data

an exact algorithm for computing the same decision probability  2525
suming chen arthur choi adnan darwiche

when using graphical models for decision making the presence of unobserved variables  may hinder our ability to reach the correct decision  a fundamental question here is whether or not  one is ready to make a decision stopping criteria and if not what additional  observations should be made in order to better prepare for a decision  selection criteria  a recently introduced notion the same decision probability sdp has been shown to be useful  as both a stopping and a selection criteria  this query has been shown to be highly intractable  being pppp complete and is exemplary of a class of queries which correspond to the computation of certain expectations  we propose the first exact algorithm for computing the sdp in this paper and demonstrate its effectiveness on several real and synthetic networks  we also present a new complexity result for computing the sdp on models with a naive bayes structure

probabilistic reasoning with undefined properties in ontologically based belief networks  2532
chia li kuo david buchman arzoo katiyar david poole

this paper concerns building probabilistic models with an underlying ontology that defines the classes and properties used in the model in particular it considers the problem of reasoning with properties that may not always be defined furthermore we may even be uncertain about whether a property is defined for a given individual one approach is to explicitly add a value "undefined" to the range of random variables forming extended belief networks however adding an extra value to a random variables range has a large computational overhead in this paper we propose an alternative ontologically based belief networks where all properties are only used when they are defined and we show how probabilistic reasoning can be carried out without explicitly using the value "undefined" during inference we prove this is equivalent to reasoning with the corresponding extended belief network and empirically demonstrate that inference becomes more efficient

inference for a new probabilistic constraint logic  2540
steffen michels arjen hommersom peter j f lucas marina velikova pieter koopman

probabilistic logics combine the expressive power of logic with the ability to reason with uncertainty several probabilistic logic languages have been proposed in the past each of them with their own features in this paper we propose a new probabilistic constraint logic programming language which combines constraint logic programming with probabilistic reasoning the language supports modeling of discrete as well as continuous probability distributions by expressing constraints on random variables we introduce the declarative semantics of this language present an exact inference algorithm to derive bounds on the joint probability distributions consistent with the specified constraints and give experimental results the results obtained are encouraging indicating that inference in our language is feasible for solving challenging problems

map matching with inverse reinforcement learning  2547
takayuki osogami rudy raymond

we study map matching the problem of estimating the route that is traveled by a vehicle where the points observed with the global positioning system are available a state of the art approach for this problem is a hidden markov model hmm we propose a particular transition probability between latent road segments by the use of the number of turns in addition to the travel distance between the latent road segments we use inverse reinforcement learning to estimate the importance of the number of turns relative to the travel distance this estimated importance is incorporated in the transition probability of the hmm we show through numerical experiments that the error of map matching can be reduced substantially with the proposed transition probability

accurate integration of crowdsourced labels using workers self reported confidence scores  2554
satoshi oyama yukino baba yuko sakurai hisashi kashima

we have developed a method for using confidence scores to integrate labels provided by crowdsourcing workers although confidence scores can be useful information for estimating the quality of the provided labels a way to effectively incorporate them into the integration process has not been established moreover some workers are overconfident about the quality of their labels while others are underconfident and some workers are quite accurate in judging the quality of their labels this differing reliability of the confidence scores among workers means that the probability distributions for the reported confidence scores differ among workers to address this problem we extended the dawid skene model and created two probabilistic models in which the values of unobserved true labels are inferred from the observed provided labels and reported confidence scores by using the expectation maximization algorithm results of experiments using actual crowdsourced data for image labeling and binary question answering tasks showed that incorporating workers confidence scores can improve the accuracy of integrated crowdsourced labels

look versus leap computing value of information with high dimensional streaming evidence  2561
stephanie rosenthal dan bohus ece kamar eric horvitz

a key decision facing autonomous systems with access to streams of sensory data is whether to act based on current evidence or to wait for additional information that might enhance the utility of taking an action computing the value of information is particularly difficult with streaming high dimensional sensory evidence we describe a belief projection approach to reasoning about information value in these settings using models for inferring future beliefs over states given streaming evidence these belief projection models can be learned from data or constructed via direct assessment of parameters and they fit naturally in modular hierarchical state inference architectures we describe principles of using belief projection and present results drawn from an implementation of the methodology within a conversational system

the inclusion exclusion rule and its application to the junction tree algorithm  2568
david smith vibhav gogate

in this paper we consider the inclusion exclusion rule – a known yet seldom used rule of probabilistic inference unlike the widely used sum rule which requires easy access to all joint probability values the inclusion exclusion rule requires easy access to several marginal probability values we therefore develop a new representation of the joint distribution that is amenable to the inclusion exclusion rule we compare the relative strengths and weaknesses of the inclusion exclusion rule with the sum rule and develop a hybrid rule called the inclusion  exclusion sum ies rule which combines their power we apply the ies rule to junction trees treating the latter as a target for knowledge compilation and show that in many cases it greatly reduces the time required to answer queries our experiments demonstrate the power of our approach in particular at query time on several networks our new scheme was an order of magnitude faster than the junction tree algorithm

sample complexity of risk averse bandit arm selection  2576
jia yuan yu evdokia nikolova

we consider stochastic multiarmed bandit problems where each arm generates iid rewards according to an unknown distribution whereas classical bandit solutions only maximize the expected reward we consider the problem of minimizing risk using notions such as the value at risk the average value at risk and the mean variance risk we present algorithms to minimize the risk over a single and multiple time periods along with pac accuracy guarantees given a finite number of reward samples in the single period case we show that finding the arm with least risk requires not many more samples than the arm with highest expected reward although minimizing the multi period value at risk is known to be hard we present an algorithm with comparable sample complexity under additional assumptions

a generalization of sat and sat for robust policy evaluation  2583
erik zawadzki andré platzer geoffery j gordon

both sat and sat can represent difficult problems in seemingly dissimilar areas such as planning verification and probabilistic inference here we examine an expressive new language ∃sat that generalizes both of these languages ∃sat problems require counting the number of satisfiable formulas in a concisely describable set of existentially quantified propositional formulas we characterize the expressiveness and worst case difficulty of ∃sat by proving that it is complete for the complexity class pnp1  and relating this class to more familiar complexity classes we also experiment with three new general purpose ∃sat solvers on a battery of problem distributions including a simple logistics domain our experiments show that despite the formidable worst case complexity of pnp1  many of the instances can be solved efficiently by noticing and exploiting a particular type of frequent structure

link label prediction in signed social networks  2591
priyanka agrawal vikas k garg ramasuri narayanam

online social networks continue to witness a tremendous growth both in terms of the number of registered users and their mutual interactions in this paper we focus on online signed social networks where positive interactions among the users signify friendship or approval whereas negative interactions indicate antagonism or disapproval we introduce a novel problem which we call the link label prediction problem given the information about signs of certain links in a social network we want to learn the nature of relationships that exist among the users by predicting the sign positive or negative of the remaining links we propose a matrix factorization based technique mf lisp that exhibits strong generalization guarantees we also investigate the applicability of logistic regression leskove et al in this setting our experiments on wiki vote epinions and slashdot data sets strongly corroborate the efficacy of these approaches

multi view k means clustering on big data  2598
xiao cai feiping nie heng huang

in past decade more and more data are collected from multiple sources or represented by multiple views where different views describe distinct perspectives of the data although each view could be individually used for finding patterns by clustering the clustering performance could be more accurate by exploring the rich information among multiple views several multi view clustering methods have been proposed to unsupervised integrate different views of data however they are graph based approaches eg based on spectral clustering such that they cannot handle the large scale data how to combine these heterogeneous features for unsupervised large scale data clustering has become a challenging problem in this paper we propose a new robust large scale multi view clustering method to integrate heterogeneous representations of large scale data we evaluate the proposed new methods by six benchmark data sets and compared the performance with several commonly used clustering approaches as well as the baseline multi view clustering methods in all experimental results our proposed methods consistently achieve superiors clustering performances

chen cheng haiqin yang michael r lyu irwin king

personalized point of interest poi recommendation is a significant task in location based social networks lbsns as it can help provide better user experience as well as enable third party services eg launching advertisements to provide a good recommendation various research has been conducted in the literature however pervious efforts mainly consider the "check ins" in a whole and omit their temporal relation they can only recommend poi globally and cannot know where a user would like to go tomorrow or in the next few days in this paper we consider the task of successive personalized poi recommendation in lbsns which is a much harder task than standard personalized poi recommendation or prediction to solve this task we observe two prominent properties in the check in sequence personalized markov chain and region localization hence we propose a novel matrix factorization method namely fpmclr to embed the personalized markov chains and the localized regions our proposed fpmc lr not only exploits the personalized markov chain in the check in sequence but also takes into account users movement constraint ie moving around a localized region more importantly utilizing the information of localized regions we not only reduce the computation cost largely but also discard the noisy information to boost recommendation results on two real world lbsns datasets demonstrate the merits of our proposed fpmc lr

celebrity recommendation with collaborative social topic regression  2612
xuetao ding xiaoming jin yujia li lianghao li

recently how to recommend celebrities to the public becomes an interesting problem on the social network websites such as twitter and tencent weibo in this paper we proposed a unified hierarchical bayesian model to recommend celebrities to the general users specifically we proposed to leverage both social network and descriptions of celebrities to improve the prediction ability and recommendation interpretability in our model we combine topic model with matrix factorization for both social network of celebrities and user following action matrix it works by regularizing celebrity factors through celebritys social network and descriptive words associated with each celebrity we also proposed to incorporate different confidences for different dyadic contexts to handle the situation that only positive observations exist we conducted experiments on two real world datasets from twitter and tencent weibo which are the largest and second largest microblog websites in usa and china respectively the experiment results show that our model achieves a higher performance and provide more effective results than the state of art methods especially when recommending new celebrities we also show that our model captures user intertests more precisely and gives better recommendation interpretability

a novel bayesian similarity measure for recommender systems  2619
guibing guo jie zhang neil yorke smith

collaborative filtering a widely used user centric recommendation technique predicts an items rating by aggregating its ratings from similar users user similarity is usually calculated by cosine similarity or pearson correlation coefficient however both of them consider only the direction of rating vectors and suffer from a range of drawbacks to solve these issues we propose a novel bayesian similarity measure based on the dirichlet distribution taking into consideration both the direction and length of rating vectors further our principled method reduces correlation due to chance experimental results on six real world data sets show that our method achieves superior accuracy

cross domain collaborative filtering via bilinear multilevel analysis  2626
liang hu jian cao guandong xu jie wang zhiping gu longbing cao

cross domain collaborative filtering cdcf which aims to leverage data from multiple domains to relieve the data sparsity issue is becoming an emerging research topic in recent years however current cdcf methods that mainly consider user and item factors but largely neglect the heterogeneity of domains may lead to improper knowledge transfer issues to address this problem we propose a novel cdcf model the bilinear multilevel analysis blma which seamlessly introduces multilevel analysis theory to the most successful collaborative filtering method matrix factorization mf specifically we employ blma to more efficiently address the determinants of ratings from a hierarchical view by jointly considering domain community and user effects so as to overcome the issues caused by traditional mf approaches moreover a parallel gibbs sampler is provided to learn these effects finally experiments conducted on a real world dataset demonstrate the superiority of the blma over other state of the art methods

social spammer detection in microblogging  2633
xia hu jiliang tang yanchao zhang huan liu

the availability of microblogging like twitter and sina weibo makes it a popular platform for spammers to unfairly overpower normal users with unwanted content via social networks known as social spamming the rise of social spamming can significantly hinder the use of microblogging systems for effective information dissemination and sharing distinct features of microblogging systems present new challenges for social spammer detection first unlike traditional social networks microblogging allows to establish some connections between two parties without mutual consent which makes it easier for spammers to imitate normal users by quickly accumulating a large number of "human" friends second microblogging messages are short noisy and unstructured traditional social spammer detection methods are not directly applicable to microblogging in this paper we investigate how to collectively use network and content information to perform effective social spammer detection in microblogging in particular we present an optimization formulation that models the social network and content information in a unified framework experiments on a real world twitter dataset demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively utilize both kinds of information for social spammer detection

listening to the crowd automated analysis of events via aggregated twitter sentiment  2640
yuheng hu fei wang subbarao kambhampati

individuals often express their opinions on social media platforms like twitter and facebook during public events such as the us presidential debate and the oscar awards ceremony gleaning insights from these posts is of importance to analyzing the impact of the event in this work we consider the problem of identifying the segments and topics of an event that garnered praise or criticism according to aggregated twitter responses we propose a flexible factorization framework socsent to learn factors about segments topics and sentiments to regulate the learning process several constraints based on prior knowledge on sentiment lexicon sentiment orientations on a few tweets as well as tweets alignments to the event are enforced we implement our approach using simple update rules to get the optimal solution we evaluate the proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively on two large scale tweet datasets associated with two events from different domains to show that it improves significantly over baseline models

social trust prediction using rank k matrix recovery  2647
jin huang feiping nie heng huang yu lei chris ding

trust prediction which explores the unobserved relationships between online community users is an emerging and important research topic in social network analysis and many web applications similar to other social based recommender systems trust relationships between users can be also modeled in the form of matrices recent study shows users generally establish friendship due to a few latent factors it is therefore reasonable to assume the trust matrices are of low rank as a result many recommendation system strategies can be applied here in particular trace norm minimization which uses matrixs trace norm to approximate its rank is especially appealing however recent articles cast doubts on the validity of trace norm approximation in this paper instead of using trace norm minimization we propose a new robust rank k matrix completion method which explicitly seeks a matrix with exact rank moreover our method is robust to noise or corrupted observations we optimize the new objective function in an alternative manner based on a combination of ancillary variables and augmented lagrangian multiplier alm method we perform the experiments on three real world data sets and all empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method

context dependent conceptualization  2654
dongwoo kim haixun wang alice oh

conceptualization seeks to map a short text ie a word or a phrase to a set of concepts as a mechanism of understanding text most of prior research in conceptualization uses human crafted knowledge bases that map instances to concepts such approaches to conceptualization have the limitation that the mappings are not context sensitive to overcome this limitation we propose a framework in which we harness the power of a probabilistic topic model which inherently captures the semantic relations between words by combining latent dirichlet allocation a widely used topic model with probase a large scale probabilistic knowledge base we develop a corpus based framework for context dependent conceptualization through this simple but powerful framework we improve conceptualization and enable a wide range of applications that rely on semantic understanding of short texts including frame element prediction word similarity in context ad query similarity and query similarity

freddy lécué jeff z pan

recently ontology stream reasoning has been introduced as a multidisciplinary approach merging synergies from artificial intelligence database world wide web to reason on semantic augmented data streams although knowledge evolution and real time reasoning have been largely addressed in ontology streams the challenge of predicting its future or missing knowledge remains open and yet unexplored we tackle predictive reasoning as a correlation and interpretation of past semantics augmented data over exogenous ontology streams consistent predictions are constructed as description logics entailments by selecting and applying relevant cross streams association rules the experiments have shown accurate prediction with real and live stream data from dublin city in ireland

a unified framework for reputation estimation in online rating systems  2670
guang ling irwin king michael r lyu

online rating systems are now ubiquitous due to the success of recommender systems in such systems users are allowed to rate the items movies songs commodities in a predefined range of values the ratings collected can be used to infer users preferences as well as items intrinsic features which are then matched to perform personalized recommendation most previous work focuses on improving the prediction accuracy or ranking capability little attention has been paid to the problem of spammers or low reputed users in such systems spammers contaminate the rating system by assigning unreasonable scores to items which may affect the accuracy of a recommender system there are evidences supporting the existence of spammers in online rating systems reputation estimation methods can be employed to keep track of users reputation and detect spammers in such systems in this paper we propose a unified framework for computing the reputation score of a user given only users ratings on items we show that previously proposed reputation estimation methods can be captured as special cases of our framework we propose a new low rank matrix factorization based reputation estimation method and demonstrate its superior discrimination ability

synthesizing union tables from the web  2677
xiao ling alon halevy fei wu cong yu

several recent works have focused on harvesting html tables from the web and recovering their semantics as a result hundreds of millions of high quality structured data tables can now be explored by the users in this paper we argue that those efforts only scratch the surface of the true value of structured data on the web and study the challenging problem of synthesizing tables from the web ie producing never before seen tables from raw tables on the web table synthesis offers an important semantic advantage when a set of related tables are combined into a single union table powerful mechanisms such as temporal or geographical comparison and visualization can be employed to understand and mine the underlying data holistically we focus on one fundamental task of table synthesis namely table stitching  within a given site many tables with identical schemas can be scattered across many pages  the task of table stitching involves combining such tables into a single meaningful union table and identifying extra attributes and values for its rows so that rows from different original tables can be distinguished specifically we first define the notion of stitchable tables and identify collections of tables that can be stitched second we design an effective algorithm for extracting hidden attributes that are essential for the stitching process and for aligning values of those attributes across tables to synthesize new columns we also assign meaningful names to these synthesized columns experiments on real world tables demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach

recommendation using textual opinions  2684
claudiu cristian musat yizhong liang boi faltings

many web sites collect reviews of products and services and use them provide rankings of their quality however such rankings are not personalized we investigate how the information in the reviews written by a particular user can be used to personalize the ranking she is shown we propose a new technique topic profile collaborative filtering where we build user profiles from users review texts and use these profiles to filter other review texts with the eyes of this user we verify on data from an actual review site that review texts and topic profiles indeed correlate with ratings and show that topic profile collaborative filtering provides both a better mean average error when predicting ratings and a better approximation of user preference orders

gbpr group preference based bayesian personalized ranking for one class collaborative filtering  2691
weike pan li chen

one class collaborative filtering or collaborative ranking with implicit feedback has been steadily receiving more attention mostly due to the "one class" characteristics of data in various services eg "like" in facebook and "bought" in amazon previous works for solving this problem include pointwise regression methods based on absolute rating assumptions and pairwise ranking methods with relative score assumptions where the latter was empirically found performing much better because it models users ranking related preferences more directly however the two fundamental assumptions made in the pairwise ranking methods 1 individual pairwise preference over two items and 2 independence between two users may not always hold as a response we propose a new and improved assumption group bayesian personalized ranking gbpr via introducing richer interactions among users in particular we introduce group preference to relax the aforementioned individual and independence assumptions we then design a novel algorithm correspondingly which can recommend items more accurately as shown by various ranking oriented evaluation metrics on four real world datasets in our experiments

promoting diversity in recommendation by entropy regularizer  2698
lijing qin xiaoyan zhu

we study the problem of diverse promoting recommendation task selecting a subset of diverse items that can better predict a given users preference recommendation techniques primarily based on user or item similarity can suffer from the risk that users cannot get expected information from the over specified recommendation lists in this paper we propose an entropy regularizer to capture the notion of diversity the entropy regularizer has good properties in that it satisfies monotonicity and submodularity such that when we combine it with a modular rating set function we get submodular objective function which can be maximized approximately by efficient greedy algorithm with provable constant factor guarantee of optimality we apply our approach on the top k prediction problem and evaluate its performance on movielens data set which is a standard database containing movie rating data collected from a popular online movie recommender system we compare our model with the state of the art recommendation algorithms our experiments show that the entropy regularizer effectively captures diversity and hence improves the performance of recommendation task

scmf sparse covariance matrix factorization for collaborative filtering  2705
jianping shi naiyan wang yang xia dit yan yeung irwin king jiaya jia

matrix factorization mf is a popular collaborative filtering approach for recommender systems due to its simplicity and effectiveness existing mf methods either assume that all latent features are uncorrelated or assume that all are correlated to address the important issue of what structure should be imposed on the features we investigate the covariance matrix of the latent features learned from real data based on the findings we propose an mf model with a sparse covariance prior which favors a sparse yet non diagonal covariance matrix not only can this reflect the semantics more faithfully but imposing sparsity can also have a side effect of preventing overfitting starting from a probabilistic generative model with a sparse covariance prior we formulate the model inference problem as a maximum a posteriori map estimation problem the optimization procedure makes use of stochastic gradient descent and majorization minimization for empirical validation we conduct experiments using the movielens and netflix datasets to compare the proposed method with two strong baselines which use different priors experimental results show that our sparse covariance prior can lead to performance improvement

jiliang tang xia hu huiji gao huan liu

with the fast development of social media the information overload problem becomes increasingly severe and recommender systems play an important role in helping online users find relevant information by suggesting information of potential interests social activities for online users produce abundant social relations social relations provide an independent source for recommendation presenting both opportunities and challenges for traditional recommender systems users are likely to seek suggestions from both their local friends and users with high global reputations motivating us to exploit social relations from local and global perspectives for online recommender systems in this paper we develop approaches to capture local and global social relations and propose a novel framework locabal taking advantage of both local and global social context for recommendation empirical results on real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and further experiments are conducted to understand how local and global social context work for the proposed framework

collaborative topic regression with social regularization for tag recommendation  2719
hao wang binyi chen wu jun li

recently tag recommendation tr has become a very hot research topic in data mining and related areas however neither co occurrence based methods which only use the item tag matrix nor content based methods which only use the item content information can achieve satisfactory performance in real tr applications hence how to effectively combine the item tag matrix item content information and other auxiliary information into the same recommendation framework is the key challenge for tr in this paper we first adapt the collaborative topic regression ctr model which has been successfully applied for article recommendation to combine both item tag matrix and item content information for tr furthermore by extending ctr we propose a novel hierarchical bayesian model called ctr with social regularization ctr sr to seamlessly integrate the item tag matrix item content information and social networks between items into the same principled model experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models

hao wang wu jun li

with the emergence of large scale evolving time varyingnetworks dynamic network analysis dna has become a very hot research topic in recent years although a lot of dna methods have been proposed by researchers from different communities most of them can only model snapshot data recorded at a very rough temporal granularity recently some models have been proposed for dna which can be used to model large scale citation networks at a fine temporal granularity however they suffer from a significant decrease of accuracy over time because the learned parameters or node features are static fixed during the prediction process for evolving citation networks in this paper we propose a novel modelcalled online egocentric model oem to learn time varying parameters and node features for evolving citation networks experimental results on real world citation networks show that our oem can not only prevent the prediction accuracy from decreasing over time but also uncover the evolution of topics in citation networks

zhichun wang juanzi li jie tang

automatically discovering cross lingual links cls between wikis can largely enrich the cross lingual knowledge and facilitate knowledge sharing across different languages in most existing approaches for cross lingual knowledge linking the seed cls and the inner link structures are two important factors for finding new cls when there are insufficient seed cls and inner links discovering new cls becomes a challenging problem in this paper we propose an approach that boosts cross lingual knowledge linking by concept annotation given a small number of seed cls and inner links our approach first enriches the inner links in wikis by using concept annotation method and then predicts new cls with a regression based learning model these two steps mutually reinforce each other and are executed iteratively to find as many cls as possible experimental results on the english and chinese wikipedia data show that the concept annotation can effectively improve the quantity and quality of predicted cls with 50000 seed cls and 30 of the original inner links in wikipedia our approach discovered 171393 more cls in four runs when using concept annotation

biao xiang qi liu enhong chen hui xiong yi zheng yu yang

recent years have witnessed increased interests in measuring authority and modelling influence in social networks for a long time pagerank has been widely used for authority computation and has also been adopted as a solid baseline for evaluating social influence related applications however the connection between authority measurement and influence modelling is not clearly established to this end in this paper we provide a focused study on understanding of pagerank as well as the relationship between pagerank and social influence analysis along this line we first propose a linear social influence model and reveal that this model is essentially pagerank with prior also we show that the authority computation by pagerank can be enhanced with more generalized priors moreover to deal with the computational challenge of pagerank with general priors we provide an upper bound for top authoritative nodes identification finally the experimental results on the scientific collaboration network validate the effectiveness of the proposed social influence model

social influence locality for modeling retweeting behaviors  2761
jing zhang biao liu jie tang ting chen juanzi li

we study an interesting phenomenon of social influence locality in a large microblogging network which suggests that users behaviors are mainly influenced by close friends in their ego networks we provide a formal definition for the notion of social influence locality and develop two instantiation functions based on pairwise influence and structural diversity the defined influence locality functions have strong predictive power without any additional features we can obtain a f1 score of 7165 for predicting users retweet behaviors by training a logistic regression classifier based on the defined functions our analysis also reveals several intriguing discoveries for example though the probability of a user retweeting a microblog is positively correlated with the number of friends who have retweeted the microblog it is surprisingly negatively correlated with the number of connected circles that are formed by those friends

assessing the resilience of socio ecosystems coupling viability theory and active learning with kd trees — application to bilingual societies  2776
isabelle alvarez ricardo de aldama sophie martin romain reuillon

this paper proposes a new algorithm to compute the resilience of a social system or an ecosystem when it is defined in the framework of the mathematical viability theory it is applied to the problem of language coexistence although bilingual societies do exist many languages have disappeared and some seem endangered presently mathematical models of language competition generally conclude that one language will disappear except when the relative prestige of the languages can be modified the viability theory provides concepts and tools that are suitable to study the resilience but with severe computational limits since it uses extensive search on regular grids the method we propose considers the computation of the viability output sets as an active learning problem with the objective of restraining the number of calls to the model and information storage we adapt a kd tree algorithm to approximate the level sets of the resilience value we prove that this algorithm converges to the output sets defined by the viability theory viability kernel and capture basin the resilience value we compute can then be used to propose a policy of action in risky situations such as migration flows

towards understanding global spread of disease from everyday interpersonal interactions  2783
sean brennan adam sadilek henry kautz

monitoring and forecast of global spread of infectious diseases is difficult mainly due to lack of fine grained and timely data previous work in computational epidemiology has shown that mining data from the web can improve the predictability of high level aggregate patterns of epidemics by contrast this paper explores how individuals contribute to the global spread of disease we consider the important task of predicting the prevalence of flu like illness in a given city based on interpersonal interactions of the citys residents with the outside world we use the geo tagged status updates of traveling twitter users to infer properties of the flow of individuals between cities while previous research considered only the raw volume of passengers we estimate a number of latent variables including the number of sick symptomatic travelers and the number of sick individuals to whom each traveler was exposed we show that ai techniques provide insights into the mechanisms of disease spread and significantly improve predictability of future flu outbreaks our experiments involve over 51000 individuals traveling between 75 cities prior and during a severe ongoing flu epidemic october 2012   january 2013 our model leverages the text and interpersonal interactions recorded in over 65 million online status updates without any active user participation enabling scalable public health applications

since wind has an intrinsically complex and stochastic nature accurate wind power forecasts are necessary for the safety and economics of wind energy utilization in this paper we investigate a combination of numeric and probabilistic models one day ahead wind power forecasts were made with gaussian processes gps applied to the outputs of a numerical weather prediction nwp model firstly the wind speed data from nwp was corrected by a gp then as there is always a defined limit on power generated in a wind turbine due the turbine controlling strategy a censored gp was used to model the relationship between the corrected wind speed and power output to validate the proposed approach two real world datasets were used for model construction and testing the simulation results were compared with the persistence method and artificial neural networks anns the proposed model achieves about 11 improvement in forecasting accuracy mean absolute error compared to the ann model on one dataset and nearly 5 improvement on another

semi supervised learning for integration of aerosol predictions from multiple satellite instruments  2797
nemanja djuric lakesh kansakar slobodan vucetic

aerosol optical depth aod recognized as one of the most important quantities in understanding and predicting the earths climate is estimated daily on a global scale by several earth observing satellite instruments each instrument has different coverage and sensitivity to atmospheric and surface conditions and as a result the quality of aod estimated by different instruments varies across the globe we present a method for learning how to aggregate aod estimations from multiple satellite instruments into a more accurate estimation the proposed method is semi supervised as it is able to learn from a small number of labeled data where labels come from a few accurate and expensive ground based instruments and a large number of unlabeled data the method uses a latent variable to partition the data so that in each partition the expert aod estimations are aggregated in a different optimal way we applied the method to combine aod estimations from 5 instruments aboard 4 satellites and the results indicate that it can successfully exploit labeled and unlabeled data to produce accurate aggregated aod estimations

haili dong bingsheng wang chang tien lu

the increasing demands on drinkable water along with population growth water intensive agriculture and economic development pose critical challenges to water sustainability new techniques to long term water conservation that incorporate principles of sustainability are expected recent studies have shown that providing customers with usage information of fixtures could help them save a considerable amount of water existing disaggregation techniques focus on learning consumption patterns for individual devices little attention has been given to the hierarchical decomposition structure of the aggregated consumption in this paper a deep sparse coding based recursive disaggregation model dscrdm is proposed for water conservation we design a recursive decomposition structure to perform the disaggregation task and introduce sequential set to capture its characteristics an efficient and effective algorithm deep sparse coding is developed to automatically learn the disaggregation architecture along with discriminative and reconstruction dictionaries for each layer we demonstrated that our proposed approach significantly improved the performance of the benchmark methods on a large scale disaggregation task and illustrated how our model could provide practical feedbacks to customers for water conservation

optimal pricing for improving efficiency of taxi systems  2811
jiarui gan bo an haizhong wang xiaoming sun zhongzhi shi

in beijing most taxi drivers intentionally avoid working during peak hours despite of the huge customer demand within these peak periods this dilemma is mainly due to the fact that taxi drivers congestion costs are not reflected in the current taxi fare structure to resolve this problem we propose a new pricing scheme to provide taxi drivers with extra incentives to work during peak hours this differs from previous studies of taxi market by considering market variance over multiple periods taxi drivers profit driven decisions and their scheduling constraints regarding the interdependence among different periods the major challenge of this research is the computational intensiveness to identify optimal strategy due to the exponentially large size of a taxi drivers strategy space and the scheduling constraints we develop an atom schedule method to overcome these issues it reduces the magnitude of the problem while satisfying the constraints to filter out infeasible pure strategies simulation results based on real data show the effectiveness of the proposed methods which opens up a new door to improving the efficiency of taxi market in megacities eg beijing

daniel holman mohan sridharan prasanna gowda dana porter thomas marek terry howell jerry moorhead

accurate estimates of daily crop evapotranspiration et are needed for efficient irrigation management in regions where crop water demand exceeds rainfall daily grass or alfalfa reference et values and crop coefficients are widely used to estimate crop water demand inaccurate reference et estimates can hence have a tremendous impact on irrigation costs and the demands on freshwater resources et networks calculate reference et using precise measurements of meteorological data these networks are typically characterized by gaps in spatial coverage and lack of sufficient funding creating an immediate need for alternative sources that can fill data gaps without high costs although non agricultural weather stations provide publicly accessible meteorological data there are concerns that the data may be unsuitable for estimating reference et due to factors such as weather station siting data formats and quality control issues the objective of our research is to enable the use of alternative data sources adapting sophisticated machine learning algorithms such as gaussian process models and neural networks to discover and model the nonlinear relationships between non et weather station data and the reference et computed by et networks using data from the texas high plains region in the us we demonstrate significant improvement in estimation accuracy in comparison with baseline regression models typically used for irrigation management applications

vikas joshi nithya rajamani takayuki katsuki naveen prathapaneni l v subramaniam

traffic sensing is a key baseline input for sustainable cities to plan and administer demand supply management through better road networks public transportation urban policies etc humans sense the environment frugally using a combination of complementary information signals from different sensors for example by viewing andor hearing traffic one could identify the state of traffic on the road in this paper we demonstrate a fusion based learning approach to classify the traffic states using low cost audio and image data analysis using real world dataset road side collected traffic acoustic signals and traffic image snapshots obtained from fixed camera are used to classify the traffic condition into three broad classes viz jam medium and free the classification is done on f10 sec audioimage snapshot in that 10 sec g data tuple we extract traffic relevant features from audio and image data to form a composite feature vector in particular we extract the audio features comprising mfcc mel frequency cepstral coefficients classifier based features honk events and energy peaks a simple heuristic based image classifier is used where vehicular density and number of corner points within the road segment are estimated and are used as features for traffic sensing finally the composite vector is tested for its ability to discriminate the traffic classes using decision tree classifier svm classifier discriminant classifier and logistic regression based classifier information fusion at multiple levels audio image overall shows consistently better performance than individual level decision making low cost sensor fusion based on complementary weak classifiers and noisy features still generates high quality results with an overall accuracy of 93   96

we will show how human computation insights can be key to identifying so called backdoor variables in combinatorial optimization problems backdoor variables can be used to obtain dramatic speed  ups in combinatorial search our approach leverages the complementary strength of human input based on a visual identification of problem structure crowdsourcing and the power of combinatorial solvers to exploit complex constraints we describe our work in the context of the domain of materials discovery the motivation for considering the materials discovery domain comes from the fact that new materials can provide solutions for key challenges in sustainability eg in energy new catalysts for more efficient fuel cell technology

evolution of common pool resources and social welfare in structured populations  2848
jean sébastien lerat the anh han tom lenaerts

the common pool resource cpr game is a social dilemma where agents have to decide how to consume a shared cpr either they each take their cut completely destroying the cpr or they restrain themselves gaining less immediate profit but sustaining the resource and future profit when no consumption takes place the cpr simply grows to its carrying capacity as such this dilemma provides a framework to study the evolution of social consumption strategies and the sustainability of resources whose size adjusts dynamically through consumption and their own implicit population dynamics the present study provides for the first time a detailed analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of consumption strategies in finite populations focusing on the interplay between the resource levels and preferred consumption strategies we show analytically which restrained consumers survive in relation to the growth rate of the resources and how this affects the resources carrying capacity second we show that population structures affect the sustainability of the resources and social welfare in the population current results provide an initial insight into the complexity of the cpr game showing potential for a variety of different studies in the context of social welfare and resource sustainability

tag weighted topic model for mining semi structured documents  2855
shuangyin li jiefei li rong pan

in the last decade latent dirichlet allocation lda successfully discovers the statistical distribution of the topics over a unstructured text corpus meanwhile more and more document data come up with rich human provided tag information during the evolution of the internet which called semi  structured data the semi structured data contain both unstructured data eg plain text and metadata such as papers with authors and web pages with tags in general different tags in a document play different roles with their own weights to model such semi structured documents is non trivial in this paper we propose a novel method to model tagged documents by a topic model called tag weighted topic model twtm twtm is a framework that leverages the tags in each document to infer the topic components for the documents this allows not only to learn document topic distributions but also to infer the tag topic distributions for text mining eg classification clustering and recommendations moreover twtm automatically infers the probabilistic weights of tags for each document we present an efficient variational inference method with an em algorithm for estimating the model parameters the experimental results show that our twtm approach outperforms the baseline algorithms over three corpora in document modeling and text classification

xiaojie li jian cheng lv zhang yi

manifold alignment is to extract the shared latent semantic structure from multiple manifolds the joint adjacency matrix plays a key role in manifold alignment to construct the matrix it is crucial to get more corresponding pairs this paper proposes an approach to obtain more and reliable corresponding pairs in terms of local structure correspondence the sparse reconstruction weight matrix of each manifold is established to preserve the local geometry of the original data set the sparse correspondence matrices are constructed using the sparse local structures of corresponding pairs across manifolds further more a new energy function for manifold alignment is proposed to simultaneously match the corresponding instances and preserve the local geometry of each manifold the shared low dimensional embedding which provides better descriptions for the intrinsic geometry and relations between different manifolds can be obtained by solving the optimization problem with closed form solution experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm

a global constrained optimization method for designing road networks with small diameters  2869
teng ma yuexian hou xiaozhao zhao dawei song

the road network design problem is to optimize the road network by selecting paths to improve or adding paths in the existing road network under certain constraints eg the weighted sum of modifying costs since its multi objective nature the road network design problem is often challenging for designers empirically the smaller diameter a road network has the more connected and efficient the road network is based on this observation we propose a set of constrained convex models for designing road networks with small diameters to be specific we theoretically prove that the diameter of the road network which is evaluated wrt the travel times in the network can be bounded by the algebraic connectivity in spectral graph theory since that the upper and lower bounds of diameter are inversely proportional to algebraic connectivity then we can focus on increasing the algebraic connectivity instead of reducing the network diameter under the budget constraints the above formulation leads to a semi definite program in which we can get its global solution easily then we present some simulation experiments to show the correctness of our method at last we compare our method with an existing method based on the genetic algorithm

alistair reid simon ocallaghan edwin v bonilla lachlan mccalman tim rawling fabio ramos

we propose a machine learning approach to geophysical inversion problems for the exploration of earth resources our approach is based on nonparametric bayesian methods specifically gaussian processes and provides a full distribution over the predicted geophysical properties whilst enabling the incorporation of data from different modalities we assess our method both qualitatively and quantitatively using a real dataset from south australia containing gravity and drill hole data and through simulated experiments involving gravity drill holes and magnetics with the goal of characterizing rock densities the significance of our probabilistic inversion extends to general exploration problems with potential to dramatically benefit the industry

dynamic taxi and ridesharing a framework and heuristics for the optimization problem  2885
douglas o santos eduardo c xavier

in this paper we study a dynamic problem of ridesharing and taxi sharing with time windows we consider a scenario where people needing a taxi or interested in getting a ride use a phone app to designate their source and destination points in a city as well others restrictions such as maximum allowable time to be at the destination on the other hand we have taxis and people interested in giving a ride with their current positions and also some constraints vehicle capacity destination maximum time to destination we want to maximize the number of shared trips in the case of taxis people going to close locations can share the costs of the trip and in case of rides the driver and passengers can share costs as well this problem is dynamic since new calls for taxis or calls for rides arrive on demand this give rise to an optimization problem which we prove to be np hard we then propose heuristics to deal with it we focus on the taxi sharing problem but we show that our model is easily extendable to model the ridesharing situation or even a situation where there are both taxis and car owners in addition we present a framework that consists basically of a client application and a server the last one processes all incoming information in order to match vehicles to passengers requests the entire system can be used by taxi companies and riders in a way to reduce traffic in the cities and to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases

an active learning approach to home heating in the smart grid  2892
mike shann sven seuken

a key issue for the realization of the smart grid vision is the implementation of effective demand side management one possible approach involves exposing dynamic energy prices to end users in this paper we consider a resulting problem on the users side how to adaptively heat a home given dynamic prices the user faces the challenge of having to react to dynamic prices in real time trading off his comfort with the costs of heating his home to a certain temperature we propose an active learning approach to adjust the home temperature in a semi automatic way our algorithm learns the users preferences over time and automatically adjusts the temperature in real time as prices change in addition the algorithm asks the user for feedback once a day to find the best query time the algorithm solves an optimal stopping problem via simulations we show that our algorithm learns users preferences quickly and that using the expected utility loss as the query criterion outperforms standard approaches from the active learning literature

ngoc cuong truong james mcinerney long tran thanh enrico costanza sarvapali d ramchurn

we address the problem of forecasting the usage of multiple electrical appliances by domestic users with the aim of providing suggestions about the best time to run appliances in order to reduce carbon emissions and save money assuming time of use pricing while minimising the impact on the users daily habitsan important challenge related to this problem is the modelling the everyday routine of the consumers and of the inter dependencies between the use of different appliances given this we develop an important building block of future home energy management systems a prediction algorithm based on a graphical model that captures the everyday habits and the inter dependency between appliances by exploiting their periodic featureswe demonstrate through extensive empirical evaluations on real world data from a prominent database that our approach outperforms existing methods by up to 47

randomized load control a simple distributed approach for scheduling smart appliances  2915
menkes van den briel paul scott sylvie thiébaux

a significant portion of the electricity network capacity is built to run only a few days a year when demand peaks as a result expensive power generation plants and equipment costing millions of dollars are sitting idle most of the time which increases costs for everyone we present randomized load control a simple distributed approach for scheduling smart appliances randomized load control schedules the start time of appliances that are programmed to run within a specified time window so that the aggregate load achieves a given ideal load our results show that we do achieve the given ideal load to a great extent this is remarkable as the approach is completely distributed and preserves customer privacy as the scheduling happens within each house or building separately

parameter learning for latent network diffusion  2923
xiaojian wu akshat kumar daniel sheldon shlomo zilberstein

diffusion processes in networks are increasingly used to model dynamic phenomena such as the spread of information wildlife or social influence our work addresses the problem of learning the underlying parameters that govern such a diffusion process by observing the time at which nodes become active a key advantage of our approach is that unlike previous work it can tolerate missing observations for some nodes in the diffusion process having incomplete observations is characteristic of offline networks used to model the spread of wildlife we develop an em algorithm to address parameter learning in such settings since both the e and m steps are computationally challenging we employ a number of optimization methods such as nonlinear and difference of convex programming to address these challenges evaluation of the approach on the red cockaded woodpecker conservation problem shows that it is highly robust and accurately learns parameters in various settings even with more than 80 missing data

junchi yan yu wang ke zhou jin huang chunhua tian hongyuan zha weishan dong

water pipe failures can not only have a great impact on peoples daily life but also cause significant waste of water which is an essential and precious resource to human beings as a result preventative maintenance for water pipes particularly in urban scale networks is of great importance for a sustainable society to achieve effective replacement and rehabilitation failure prediction aims to proactively find those most likely to fail pipes becomes vital and has been attracting more attention from both academia and industry especially from the civil engineering field this paper presents an already deployed industrial computational system for pipe failure prediction as an alternative to risk matrix methods often depending on ad hoc domain heuristics learning based methods are adopted using the attributes with respect to physical environmental operational conditions and etc further challenge arises in practice when lacking of profile attributes a dive into the failure records shows that the failure event sequences typically exhibit temporal clustering patterns which motivates us to use the stochastic process to tackle the failure prediction task specifically the failure sequence is formulated as a self exciting stochastic process which is to our best knowledge a novel formulation for pipe failure prediction and we show that it outperforms a baseline assuming the failure risk grows linearly with aging broad new problems and research points for the machine learning community are also introduced for future work

hiroki yanagisawa takayuki osogami

the chance constrained stochastic programming ccsp is one of the models for decision making under uncertainty  in this paper we consider the special case of the ccsp in which only the right hand side vector is random with a discrete distribution having a finite support  the unit commitment problem is one of the applications of the special case of the ccsp  existing methods for exactly solving the ccsp problems require an enumeration of scenarios when they model a ccsp problem using a mixed integer programming mip  we show how to reduce the number of scenarios enumerated in the mip model  in addition we give another compact mip formulation to approximately solve the ccsp problems

a hidden markov model based acoustic cicada detector for crowdsourced smartphone biodiversity monitoring  2945
davide zilli oliver parson geoff v merrett alex rogers

automated acoustic recognition of species aims to provide a cost effective method for biodiversity monitoring this is particularly appealing for detecting endangered animals with a distinctive call such as the new forest cicada to this end we pursue a crowdsourcing approach whereby the millions of visitors to the new forest will help to monitor the presence of this cicada by means of a smartphone app that can detect its mating call however current systems for acoustic insect classification are aimed at batch processing and not suited to a real time approach as required by this system because they are too computationally expensive and not robust to environmental noise to address this shortcoming we propose a novel insect detection algorithm based on a hidden markov model to which we feed as a single feature vector the ratio of two key frequencies extracted through the goertzel algorithm our results show that this novel approach compared to the state of the art for batch insect classification is much more robust to noise while also reducing the computational cost

adam bjorndahl joseph y halpern rafael pass

we introduce language based games a generalization of psychological games geanakoplos pearce and stacchetti 1989 that can also capture reference dependent preferences koszegi and rabin 2006 which extend the domain of the utility function to "situations" maximal consistent sets in some language the role of the underlying language in this framework thus becomes particularly critical of particular interest are situations where the language can express only coarse beliefs mullainathan 2002 despite the expressive power of the approach we show that it it can describe games in a simple natural way nash equilibrium and rationalizability are generalized to this setting nash equilibrium is shown not to exist in general while the existence of rationalizable strategies is proved under mild conditions

we establish the unexpected power of conflict driven clause learning cdcl proof search by proving that the sets of unsatisfiable clauses obtained from the guarded graph tautology principles of alekhnovich johannsen pitassi and urquhart have polynomial size pool resolution refutations that use only input lemmas as learned clauses we further show that under the correct heuristic choices these refutations can be carried out in polynomial time by cdcl proof search without restarts even when restricted to greedy unit propagating search the guarded graph tautologies had been conjectured to separate cdcl without restarts from resolution our results refute this conjecture

tom claassen tom heskes

we target the problem of accuracy and robustness in causal inference from finite data sets our aim is to combine the inherent robustness of the bayesian approach with the theoretical strength and clarity of constraint based methods we use a bayesian score to obtain probability estimates on the input statements used in a constraint based procedure these are subsequently processed in decreasing order of reliability letting more reliable decisions take precedence in case of conflicts until a single output model is obtained tests show that a basic implementation of the resulting bayesian constraint based causal discovery bccd algorithm already outperforms established procedures such as fci and conservative pc it indicates which causal decisions in the output have high reliability and which do not the approach is easily adapted to other application areas such as complex independence tests

improving the effectiveness of time based display advertising extended abstract  3007
daniel g goldstein r preston mcafee siddharth suri

cpm or cost per thousand impressions is the prevalent metric used for selling online display ads in previous work we have shown that the exposure duration of an ad has strong effects on the likelihood of an ad being remembered with the first seconds of exposure having the greatest impact on memory because an ad pricing metric that is based on both time and impressions should be more exact than one based on impressions alone the industry has good reasons to move towards time based advertising we address the following unanswered question how should time based ads be scheduled we test and present one schedule that leads to greater total recollection which advertisers want and increased revenue which publishers want first we find that presenting two short successive ads results in more total recollection than presenting one longer ad of twice the duration second we show that this effect disappears as the duration of these ads increases together these findings suggest a form of time based ad pricing that should appeal to advertisers and publishers alike

preference based cbr general ideas and basic principles  3012
eyke hüllermeier weiwei cheng

building on recent research on preference handling in artificial intelligence and related fields our goal is to develop a coherent and generic methodological framework for case based reasoning cbr on the basis of formal concepts and methods for knowledge representation and reasoning with preferences a preference based approach to cbr appears to be appealing for several reasons notably because case based experiences naturally lend themselves to representations in terms of preference or order relations moreover the flexibility and expressiveness of a preference based formalism well accommodate the uncertain and approximate nature of case based problem solving in this paper we outline the basic ideas of preference based cbr and sketch a formal framework for realizing these ideas

sound complete and minimal query rewriting for existential rules  3017
mélanie könig michel leclère marie laure mugnier michaël thomazo

we address the issue of ontology based data access which consists of exploiting the semantics expressed in ontologies while querying data ontologies are represented in the framework of existential rules also known as datalog  we focus on the backward chaining paradigm which involves rewriting the query assumed to be a conjunctive query cq into a set of cqs seen as a union of cqs the proposed algorithm accepts any set of existential rules as input and stops for so called finite unification sets of rules fus the rewriting step relies on a graph notion called a piece which allows to identify subsets of atoms from the query that must be processed together we first show that our rewriting method computes a minimal set of cqs when this set is finite ie the set of rules is a fus we then focus on optimizing the rewriting step first experiments are reported in the associated technical report

collaborative filtering on ordinal user feedback  3022
yehuda koren joseph sill

we propose a collaborative filtering cf recommendation framework which is based on viewing user feedback on products as ordinal rather than the more common numerical view such an ordinal view frequently provides a more natural reflection of the user intention when providing qualitative ratings allowing users to have different internal scoring scales moreover we can address scenarios where assigning numerical scores to different types of user feedback would not be easy the framework can wrap most collaborative filtering algorithms enabling algorithms previously designed for numerical values to handle ordinal values we demonstrate our framework by wrapping a leading matrix factorization cf method a cornerstone of our method is its ability to predict a full probability distribution of the expected item ratings rather than only a single score for an item one of the advantages this brings is a novel approach to estimating the confidence level in each individual prediction compared to previous approaches to confidence estimation ours is more principled and empirically superior in its accuracy we demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on two of the largest publicly available datasets the netflix data and the yahoo music data

discovering alignments in ontologies of linked data  3032
rahul parundekar craig a knoblock josé luis ambite

recently large amounts of data are being published using semantic web standards simultaneously there has been a steady rise in links between objects from multiple sources however the ontologies behind these sources have remained largely disconnected thereby challenging the interoperability goal of the semantic web we address this problem by automatically finding alignments between concepts from multiple linked data sources instead of only considering the existing concepts in each ontology we hypothesize new composite concepts defined using conjunctions and disjunctions of rdf types and value restrictions and generate alignments between them in addition our techniques provide a novel method for curating the linked data web by pointing to likely incorrect or missing assertions our approach provides a deeper understanding of the relationships between linked data sources and increases the interoperability among previously disconnected ontologies

a new trajectory deformation algorithm based on affine transformations  3037
quang cuong pham yoshihiko nakamura

we propose a method to deform robot trajectories based on affine transformations at the heart of our approach is the concept of affine invariance trajectories are deformed in order to avoid unexpected obstacles or to attain new goals but at the same time certain precise features of the original motions are preserved such features include for instance trajectory smoothness periodicity affine velocity or more generally all affine invariant features which are of particular importance in human centered applications furthermore the proposed method is very efficient and easy to implement there is no need to re integrate even a part of the trajectory and in most cases closed form solutions can be worked out the method is also versatile optimization of geometric and dynamics parameters or satisfaction of inequality constraints can be taken into account in a very natural way as illustration we present a method for transferring human motions to humanoid robots while preserving equi affine velocity building on the presented affine deformation framework we finally revisit the concept of trajectory redundancy from the viewpoint of group theory

most time series data mining algorithms use similarity search as a core subroutine and thus the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series data mining algorithms the difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored in this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time we demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact in large datasets we can exactly search under dtw much more quickly than the current state of the art euclidean distance search algorithms we demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted we show that our ideas allow us to solve higher level time series data mining problems at scales that would otherwise be untenable

on stochastic optimal control and reinforcement learning by approximate inference extended abstract  3052
konrad rawlik marc toussaint sethu vijayakumar

we present a reformulation of the stochastic optimal control problem in terms of kl divergence minimisation not only providing a unifying perspective of previous approaches in this area but also demonstrating that the formalism leads to novel practical approaches to the control problem specifically a natural relaxation of the dual formulation gives rise to exact iterative solutions to the finite and infinite horizon stochastic optimal control problem while direct application of bayesian inference methods yields instances of risk sensitive control

at home with agents exploring attitudes towards future smart energy infrastructures  3057
tom a rodden joel e fischer nadia pantidi khaled bachour stuart moran

this paper considers how consumers might relate to future smart energy grids we used animated sketches to convey the nature of a future energy infrastructure based on software agents users showed a considerable lack of trust in energy companies raising a dilemma of design while users might welcome software agents to help in engaging with complex energy infrastructures they had little faith in those that might provide them this suggests the need to consider how to design software agents to enhance trust in these socio economic settings

jonathan rubin ian watson

given a set of data recorded by observing the decisions of an expert player we present a case based framework that allows the successful generalisation of those decisions in the game of no limit texas holdem we address the problems of determining a suitable action abstraction and the resulting state translation that is required to map real value bet amounts into a discrete set of abstract actions we also detail the similarity metrics used in order to identify similar scenarios without which no generalisation of playing decisions would be possible we show that we were able to successfully generalise no limit betting decisions from recorded data via our agent sartrenl which achieved a 5th place finish out of 11 opponents at the 2012 annual computer poker competition

modeling the interplay of peoples location interactions and social ties  3067
adam sadilek henry kautz jeffrey p bigham

location plays an essential role in our lives bridging our online and offline worlds this paper explores the interplay of peoples location interactions and social ties within a large real world dataset we present and evaluate flap a system that solves two intimately related tasks link and location prediction in online social networks for link prediction flap infers social ties by considering patterns in friendship formation the content of peoples messages and user location we show that while each component is a weak predictor of friendship alone combining them results in a strong model   accurately identifying the majority of friendships for location prediction flap implements a scalable probabilistic model of human mobility where we treat users with known gps positions as noisy sensors of the location of their friends we explore supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios and focus on the efficiency of both learning and inference we evaluate flap on a large sample of highly active users from two distinct geographical areas and show that it 1 reconstructs the entire friendship graph with high accuracy even when no edges are given and 2 infers peoples fine grained location even when they keep their data private and we can only access the location of their friends our models significantly outperform current approaches to either task

active evaluation of ranking functions based on graded relevance extended abstract  3072
christoph sawade steffen bickel timo von oertzen tobias scheffer niels landwehr

evaluating the quality of ranking functions is a core task in web search and other information retrieval domains because query distributions and item relevance change over time ranking models often cannot be evaluated accurately on held out training data instead considerable effort is spent on manually labeling the relevance of query results for test queries in order to track ranking performance we address the problem of estimating ranking performance as accurately as possible on a fixed labeling budget estimates are based on a set of most informative test queries selected by an active sampling distribution query labeling costs depend on the number of result items and item specific attributes such as document length we derive cost optimal sampling distributions for commonly used ranking performance measures experiments on web search engine data illustrate significant reductions in labeling costs

yue shi alexandros karatzoglou linas baltrunas martha larson nuria oliver alan hanjalic

in this paper we tackle the problem of recommendation in the scenarios with binary relevance data when only a few k items are recommended to individual users past work on collaborative filtering cf has either not addressed the ranking problem for binary relevance datasets or not specifically focused on improving top k recommendations to solve the problem we propose a new cf approach collaborative less is more filtering climf in climf the model parameters are learned by directly maximizing the mean reciprocal rank mrr which is a well known information retrieval metric for capturing the performance of top k recommendations we achieve linear computational complexity by introducing a lower bound of the smoothed reciprocal rank metric experiments on two social network datasets show that climf significantly outperforms a naive baseline and two state of the art cf methods

cultural diversity for virtual characters extended abstract  3121
birgit endrass

in human conversation meaning is transported through several channels such as verbal and nonverbal behavior certain of these behavioral aspects are culturally dependent mutual understanding or acceptance is thus amongst others depended on the cultural background of the interlocutors when designing virtual character behavior culture should be considered as it may improve the characters acceptance by users of certain cultural backgrounds this paper proposes a hybrid approach for the generation of culture specific behaviors in a multiagent system a computational model has been established by refining theoretical knowledge of culture specific behavior with statistical data extracted from a video corpus of german and japanese first time meetings evaluation studies of such culturally enhanced virtual characters were conducted in both targeted cultures results indicate that human observers tend to prefer character behavior that was designed to resemble their own cultural background

social norms for self policing multi agent systems and virtual societies extended abstract  3136
daniel villatoro

social norms are one of the mechanisms for decentralized societies to achieve coordination amongst individuals such norms are conflict resolution strategies that develop from the population interactions instead of a centralized entity dictating agent protocolone of the most important characteristics of social norms is that they are imposed by the members of the society and they are responsible for the fulfillment and defense of these norms by allowing agents to manage impose abide by and defend social norms societies achieve a higher degree of freedom by lacking the necessity of authorities supervising all the interactions amongst agents in this article we summarize the contributions of my dissertation where we provide an unifying framework for the analysis of social norms in virtual societies providing an strong emphasis on virtual agents and humans

revisiting centrality as relevance support sets and similarity as geometric proximity extended abstract  3175
ricardo ribeiro david martins de matos

in automatic summarization centrality as  relevance means that the most important content of an information source or of a collection of information sources corresponds to the most central passages considering a representation where such notion makes sense graph spatial etc we assess the main paradigms and intro  duce a new centrality based relevance model for automatic summarization that relies on the use of support sets to better estimate the relevant content geometric proximity is used to compute semantic relatedness centrality relevance is determined by considering the whole input source and not only local information and by taking into account the existence of minor topics or lateral subjects in the information sources to be summarized the method consists in creating for each passage of the input source a support set consisting only of the most semantically related passages then the determination of the most relevant content is achieved by selecting the passages that oc  cur in the largest number of support sets this model produces extractive summaries that are generic and language  and domain independent thorough automatic evaluation shows that the method achieves state of the art performance both in written text and automatically transcribed speech summarization even when compared to considerably more complex approaches

generalized biwords for bitext compression and translation spotting extended abstract  3180
felipe sánchez martínez rafael c carrasco miguel a martínez prieto joaquín adiego

large bilingual parallel texts also known as bitexts are usually stored in a compressed form and previous work has shown that they can be more efficiently compressed if the fact that the two texts are mutual translations is exploited for example a bitext can be seen as a sequence of biwords — pairs of parallel words with a high probability of co occurrence — that can be used as an intermediate representation in the compression process however the simple biword approach described in the literature can only exploit one to one word alignments and cannot tackle the reordering of words we therefore introduce a generalization of biwords which can describe multi word expressions and reorderings we also describe some methods for the binary compression of generalized biword sequences and compare their performance when different schemes are applied to the extraction of the biword sequence in addition we show that this generalization of biwords allows for the implementation of an efficient algorithm to look on the compressed bitext for words or text segments in one of the texts and retrieve their counterpart translations in the other text    an application usually referred to as translation spotting    with only some minor modifications in the compression algorithm

computing text semantic relatedness using the contents and links of a hypertext encyclopedia extended abstract  3185
majid yazdani andrei popescu belis

we propose methods for computing semantic relatedness between words or texts by using knowledge from hypertext encyclopedias such as wikipedia a network of concepts is built by filtering the encyclopedias articles each concept corresponding to an article a random walk model based on the notion of visiting probability vp is employed to compute the distance between nodes and then between sets of nodesto transfer learning from the network of concepts to text analysis tasks we develop two common representation approaches in the first approach the shared representation space is the set of concepts in the network and every text is represented in this space in the second approach a latent space is used as the shared representation and a transformation from words to the latent space is trained over vp scoreswe applied our methods to four important tasks in natural language processing word similarity document similarity document clustering and classification and ranking in information retrieval the performance is state of the art or close to it for each task thus demonstrating the generality of the proposed knowledge resource and the associated methods

decision theoretic approximations for machine learning  3201
m ehsan abbasnejad

decision theory focuses on the problem of making decisions under uncertainty this uncertainty arises from the unknown aspects of the state of the world the decision maker is in or the unknown utility function of performing actions the uncertainty can be modeled as a probability distribution capturing our belief about the world the decision maker is in upon making new observations the decision maker becomes more confident about this model in addition if there is a prior belief on this uncertainty that may have obtained from similar experiments the bayesian methods may be employed the loss incurred by the decision maker can also be utilized for the optimal action selection most machine learning algorithms developed though focus on one of these aspects for learning and prediction either learning the probabilistic model or minimizing the loss in probabilistic models approximate inference the process of obtaining the desired model from the observations when its is not tractable does not consider the task loss on the other end of the spectrum the common practice in learning is to minimize the task loss without considering the uncertainty of prediction model therefore we investigate the intersection of decision theory and machine learning considering both uncertainty in prediction model and the task loss

strategic interactions among agents with bounded rationality  3219
pablo hernandez leal enrique munoz de cote l enrique sucar

interactions among agents are complicated since in order to make the best decisions each agent has to take into account not only the strategy used by other agents but also how those strategies might change in the future and what causes these changes the objective of my work will be to develop a framework for learning agent models opponent or teammate more accurately and with less interactions with a special focus on fast learning non stationary strategies as preliminary work we have proposed an initial approach for learning non stationary strategies in repeated games we use decision trees to learn a model of the agent and we transform the learned trees into a mdp and solve it to obtain the optimal policy

problem transformations and algorithm selection for csps  3221
barry hurley barry osullivan

our initial line of research has shown that to achieve the best performance on a constraint satisfaction problem it may be beneficial to translate it to a satisfiability problem for this translation it is important to choose both the encoding and satisfiability solver in combination by doing so the contrasting performance among solvers on different representations of the same problem can be exploited in taking these considerations into account the performance of a solver portfolio augmented with multiple problem transformations can be improved significantly compared to restricting the portfolio to a single problem representation

rolling dispersion and exploration for robot teams  3223
elizabeth a jensen

after a disaster human rescuers may have to wait for better conditions before beginning to search for survivors a team of robots could enter long before the humans and scope out the environment to gather information that could help to prioritize tasks for the rescue operation we have developed an algorithm to allow a small group of robots to progressively explore an unknown environment moving as a group until full exploration is achieved the novel concept behind this algorithm comes from the way in which the team stays together as a group maintaining communication in order to ensure full exploration as well as a path to the exit we demonstrate in simulation that the algorithm works in multiple environments under varying conditions

towards the design of robust trust and reputation systems  3225
siwei jiang

in reputation systems for multiagent based e marketplaces buying agents model the reputation of selling agents based on ratings shared by other buyers called advisors with the existence of unfair rating attacks from dishonest advisors the effectiveness of reputation systems thus heavily relies on whether buyers can accurately determine which advisors to include in trust networks and their trustworthiness in this paper we propose two approaches to deal with unfair rating attacks the first method is to combine the advantages of different categorical trust models secondly we propose a novel multiagent evolutionary trust model met where each buyer constructs its trust network information about which advisors should be include in the network and their trustworthiness by the evolutionary model experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithms are more robust than the state of the art trust models against various unfair rating attacks

ka man lei

gutierrez and meseguer show how to enforce consistency during distributed search in the bnb adopt algorithm for distributed constraint optimization but they consider only unconditional deletions however during search more values can be pruned conditionally according to variable instantiations that define subproblems enforcing consistency in these subproblems can cause further search space reduction here we introduce methods to maintain soft arc consistencies in every subproblem during search difficulties lie in the asynchronicity of the algorithm and on the overheads induced by backtracking and undoing after a careful implementation experimental results show substantial benefits on several benchmarks

normative conflict detection and resolution in cooperating institutions  3231
tingting li

institutions also called normative frameworks provide an effective mechanism to govern agents in open distributed systems an institution specifies a set of norms with respect to the achievement of a goal or goals that regulate agents behaviours in terms of permissions empowerments and obligations however in most real circumstances several institutions probably have to cooperate to govern the same entities simultaneously which is very likely to give rise to norm conflicts simply if institutions will be designed independently and typically with different goals in this thesis we aim i to identify the different ways to combine institutions ii to model those ways formally and computationally by extending an existing model for single institutions iii to detect conflicts in different types of combined institutions automatically and iv to resolve those conflicts via automatic norm revision using an approach based on inductive learning

arbitration and stability in cooperative games with overlapping coalitions  3251
yair zick

in cooperative games with overlapping coalitions overlapping coalition formation games or ocf games agents may devote only some of their resources to a coalition allowing the formation of overlapping coalition structures having formed coalitions and generated profits agents must agree on some reasonable manner in which to divide the payoffs from the coalitions they are members of in this thesis we study stability in ocf games as shown in chalkiadakis et al 2010 stability in ocf games strongly depends on the way non deviators react to deviation this is because when a set deviates it may still interact with non deviators post deviation we begin by proposing a formal framework for handling deviation in ocf games which we term arbitration functions given a set deviation the arbitration function specifies the payoff each coalition involving non deviators is willing to give the deviating set using our framework we define and analyze several ocf solution concepts we show that under some assumptions on the underlying structure of the ocf game one can find core outcomes in ocf games in polynomial time finally we provide sufficient conditions for core stability for the conservative refined and optimistic arbitration functions

applications to motivate extending these techniques towards analogous surfaceless sketches yet surface sketch recognition techniques remain largely untested in surfaceless environments and are still highly constrained for related surfaceless gesture recognition techniques the focus of the research is to investigate the performance of surface sketch recognition techniques in more challenging surfaceless environments with the aim of addressing existing limitations through improved surfaceless sketch recognition techniques

behavior composition optimization  3247
nitin yadav

the behavior composition problem involves the automatic synthesis of a controller that is able to "realize" ie implement a desired target behavior specification by suitably coordinating a set of already available behaviors while the problem has been thoroughly studied one open issue has resisted a principled solution if the target specification is not fully realizable is there a way to realize it "at best" in this doctoral work we look at quantitative and qualitative ways to address this question

incorporating expert judgement into bayesian network machine learning  3249
yun zhou norman fenton martin neil cheng zhu

we review the challenges of bayesian network learning especially parameter learning and specify the problem of learning with sparse data we explain how it is possible to incorporate both qualitative knowledge and data with a multinomial parameter learning method to achieve more accurate predictions with sparse data

arbitration and stability in cooperative games with overlapping coalitions  3251
yair zick

in cooperative games with overlapping coalitions overlapping coalition formation games or ocf games agents may devote only some of their resources to a coalition allowing the formation of overlapping coalition structures having formed coalitions and generated profits agents must agree on some reasonable manner in which to divide the payoffs from the coalitions they are members of in this thesis we study stability in ocf games as shown in chalkiadakis et al 2010 stability in ocf games strongly depends on the way non deviators react to deviation this is because when a set deviates it may still interact with non deviators post deviation we begin by proposing a formal framework for handling deviation in ocf games which we term arbitration functions given a set deviation the arbitration function specifies the payoff each coalition involving non deviators is willing to give the deviating set using our framework we define and analyze several ocf solution concepts we show that under some assumptions on the underlying structure of the ocf game one can find core outcomes in ocf games in polynomial time finally we provide sufficient conditions for core stability for the conservative refined and optimistic arbitration functions
